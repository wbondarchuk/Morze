CHAPTER I
IN MY YOUNGER AND MORE VULNERABLE YEARS MY FATHER GAVE ME SOME ADVICE THAT InullE BEEN TURNING OVER IN MY MIND EVER SINCE.
nullHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE CRITICIZING ANYONE,nullHE TOLD ME, nullUST REMEMBER THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD HAVENnull HAD THE ADVANTAGES THAT YOUnullE HAD.nullE DIDNnull SAY ANY MORE, BUT WEnullE ALWAYS BEEN UNUSUALLY COMMUNICATIVE IN A RESERVED WAY, AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE MEANT A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THAT. IN CONSEQUENCE, Inull INCLINED TO RESERVE ALL JUDGMENTS, A HABIT THAT HAS OPENED UP MANY CURIOUS NATURES TO ME AND ALSO MADE ME THE VICTIM OF NOT A FEW VETERAN BORES. THE ABNORMAL MIND IS QUICK TO DETECT AND ATTACH ITSELF TO THIS QUALITY WHEN IT APPEARS IN A NORMAL PERSON, AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT IN COLLEGE I WAS UNJUSTLY ACCUSED OF BEING A POLITICIAN, BECAUSE I WAS PRIVY TO THE SECRET GRIEFS OF WILD, UNKNOWN MEN. MOST OF THE CONFIDENCES WERE UNSOUGHT nullFREQUENTLY I HAVE FEIGNED SLEEP, PREOCCUPATION, OR A HOSTILE LEVITY WHEN I REALIZED BY SOME UNMISTAKABLE SIGN THAT AN INTIMATE REVELATION WAS QUIVERING ON THE HORIZON; FOR THE INTIMATE REVELATIONS OF YOUNG MEN, OR AT LEAST THE TERMS IN WHICH THEY EXPRESS THEM, ARE USUALLY PLAGIARISTIC AND MARRED BY OBVIOUS SUPPRESSIONS. RESERVING JUDGMENTS IS A MATTER OF INFINITE HOPE. I AM STILL A LITTLE AFRAID OF MISSING SOMETHING IF I FORGET THAT, AS MY FATHER SNOBBISHLY SUGGESTED, AND I SNOBBISHLY REPEAT, A SENSE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DECENCIES IS PARCELLED OUT UNEQUALLY AT BIRTH.
nullND, AFTER BOASTING THIS WAY OF MY TOLERANCE, I COME TO THE ADMISSION THAT IT HAS A LIMIT. CONDUCT MAY BE FOUNDED ON THE HARD ROCK OR THE WET MARSHES, BUT AFTER A CERTAIN POINT I DONnull CARE WHAT ITnull FOUNDED ON. WHEN I CAME BACK FROM THE EASTnull - THE EAST nullnull nullnullnullLAST AUTUMN I FELT THAT I WANTED THE WORLD TO BE IN UNIFORM AND AT A SORT OF MORAL ATTENTION FOREVER; I WANTED NO MORE RIOTOUS EXCURSIONS WITH PRIVILEGED GLIMPSES INTO THE HUMAN HEART. ONLY GATSBY, THE MAN WHO GIVES HIS NAME TO THIS BOOK, WAS EXEMPT FROM MY REACTION nullGATSBY, WHO REPRESENTED EVERYTHING FOR WHICH I HAVE AN UNAFFECTED SCORN. IF PERSONALITY IS AN UNBROKEN SERIES OF SUCCESSFUL GESTURES, THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING GORGEOUS ABOUT HIM, SOME HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY TO THE PROMISES OF LIFE, AS IF HE WERE RELATED TO ONE OF THOSE INTRICATE MACHINES THAT REGISTER EARTHQUAKES TEN THOUSAND MILES AWAY. THIS RESPONSIVENESS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT FLABBY IMPRESSIONABILITY WHICH IS DIGNIFIED UNDER THE NAME OF THE nullREATIVE TEMPERAMENTnullnullIT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY GIFT FOR HOPE, A ROMANTIC READINESS SUCH AS I HAVE NEVER FOUND IN ANY OTHER PERSON AND WHICH IT IS NOT LIKELY I SHALL EVER FIND AGAIN. NO nullGATSBY TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT AT THE END; IT IS WHAT PREYED ON GATSBY, WHAT FOUL DUST FLOATED IN THE WAKE OF HIS DREAMS THAT TEMPORARILY CLOSED OUT MY INTEREST IN THE ABORTIVE SORROWS AND SHORT-WINDED ELATIONS OF MEN.
nullY FAMILY HAVE BEEN PROMINENT, WELL-TO-DO PEOPLE IN THIS MIDDLE WESTERN CITY FOR THREE GENERATIONS. THE CARRAWAYS ARE SOMETHING OF A CLAN, AND WE HAVE A TRADITION THAT WEnullE DESCENDED FROM THE DUKES OF BUCCLEUCH, BUT THE ACTUAL FOUNDER OF MY LINE WAS MY GRANDFATHERnull BROTHER, WHO CAME HERE IN FIFTY-ONE, SENT A SUBSTITUTE TO THE CIVIL WARnull - THE CIVIL WAR nullnullnull1861null865 null nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull nullnullnull11 nullnull nullnullnullnullnullnull1860 null AND STARTED THE WHOLESALE HARDWARE BUSINESS THAT MY FATHER CARRIES ON TODAY.
null NEVER SAW THIS GREAT-UNCLE, BUT Inull SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE HIM nullWITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE RATHER HARD-BOILED PAINTING THAT HANGS IN FATHERnull OFFICE. I GRADUATED FROM NEW HAVENnull - NEW HAVEN nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnull nullnull1701 null nullnullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnullIN 1915, JUST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AFTER MY FATHER, AND A LITTLE LATER I PARTICIPATED IN THAT DELAYED TEUTONICnull - TEUTONIC nullnull TEUTONIC PEOPLES nullnullnullnullnullnullnullMIGRATION KNOWN AS THE GREAT WARnull - THE GREAT WAR nullnullnullnull1914null918 nullnull I ENJOYED THE COUNTER-RAID SO THOROUGHLY THAT I CAME BACK RESTLESS. INSTEAD OF BEING THE WARM CENTRE OF THE WORLD, THE MIDDLE WEST NOW SEEMED LIKE THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE nullSO I DECIDED TO GO EAST AND LEARN THE BOND BUSINESS. EVERYBODY I KNEW WAS IN THE BOND BUSINESS, SO I SUPPOSED IT COULD SUPPORT ONE MORE SINGLE MAN. ALL MY AUNTS AND UNCLES TALKED IT OVER AS IF THEY WERE CHOOSING A PREP SCHOOL FOR ME, AND FINALLY SAID, nullHY nullYE-ES,nullWITH VERY GRAVE, HESITANT FACES. FATHER AGREED TO FINANCE ME FOR A YEAR, AND AFTER VARIOUS DELAYS I CAME EAST, PERMANENTLY, I THOUGHT, IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY-TWO.
nullHE PRACTICAL THING WAS TO FIND ROOMS IN THE CITY, BUT IT WAS A WARM SEASON, AND I HAD JUST LEFT A COUNTRY OF WIDE LAWNS AND FRIENDLY TREES, SO WHEN A YOUNG MAN AT THE OFFICE SUGGESTED THAT WE TAKE A HOUSE TOGETHER IN A COMMUTING TOWN, IT SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT IDEA. HE FOUND THE HOUSE, A WEATHER-BEATEN CARDBOARD BUNGALOW AT EIGHTY A MONTH, BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE THE FIRM ORDERED HIM TO WASHINGTON, AND I WENT OUT TO THE COUNTRY ALONE. I HAD A DOG nullAT LEAST I HAD HIM FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL HE RAN AWAY nullAND AN OLD DODGE AND A FINNISH WOMAN, WHO MADE MY BED AND COOKED BREAKFAST AND MUTTERED FINNISH WISDOM TO HERSELF OVER THE ELECTRIC STOVE.
nullT WAS LONELY FOR A DAY OR SO UNTIL ONE MORNING SOME MAN, MORE RECENTLY ARRIVED THAN I, STOPPED ME ON THE ROAD.
nullOW DO YOU GET TO WEST EGG VILLAGEnull - WEST EGG VILLAGE nullnullnullnullnullnullHE ASKED HELPLESSLY.
null TOLD HIM. AND AS I WALKED ON I WAS LONELY NO LONGER. I WAS A GUIDE, A PATHFINDER, AN ORIGINAL SETTLER. HE HAD CASUALLY CONFERRED ON ME THE FREEDOM OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.
nullND SO WITH THE SUNSHINE AND THE GREAT BURSTS OF LEAVES GROWING ON THE TREES, JUST AS THINGS GROW IN FAST MOVIES, I HAD THAT FAMILIAR CONVICTION THAT LIFE WAS BEGINNING OVER AGAIN WITH THE SUMMER.
nullHERE WAS SO MUCH TO READ, FOR ONE THING, AND SO MUCH FINE HEALTH TO BE PULLED DOWN OUT OF THE YOUNG BREATH-GIVING AIR. I BOUGHT A DOZEN VOLUMES ON BANKING AND CREDIT AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND THEY STOOD ON MY SHELF IN RED AND GOLD LIKE NEW MONEY FROM THE MINT, PROMISING TO UNFOLD THE SHINING SECRETS THAT ONLY MIDASnull - MIDAS nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnull nullnull nullnull nullnullnullnull nullnullnullAND MORGANnull - MORGAN nullnullnullnull(1837null913), nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullAND MAECENASnull - MAECENAS nullnullnull(70 nullnullnullnull8 nullnullnull), nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullKNEW. AND I HAD THE HIGH INTENTION OF READING MANY OTHER BOOKS BESIDES. I WAS RATHER LITERARY IN COLLEGE nullONE YEAR I WROTE A SERIES OF VERY SOLEMN AND OBVIOUS EDITORIALS FOR THE YALE NEWS nullAND NOW I WAS GOING TO BRING BACK ALL SUCH THINGS INTO MY LIFE AND BECOME AGAIN THAT MOST LIMITED OF ALL SPECIALISTS, THE nullELL-ROUNDED MAN.nullTHIS ISNnull JUST AN EPIGRAM nullLIFE IS MUCH MORE SUCCESSFULLY LOOKED AT FROM A SINGLE WINDOW, AFTER ALL.
nullT WAS A MATTER OF CHANCE THAT I SHOULD HAVE RENTED A HOUSE IN ONE OF THE STRANGEST COMMUNITIES IN NORTH AMERICA. IT WAS ON THAT SLENDER RIOTOUS ISLAND WHICH EXTENDS ITSELF DUE EAST OF NEW YORK nullAND WHERE THERE ARE, AMONG OTHER NATURAL CURIOSITIES, TWO UNUSUAL FORMATIONS OF LAND. TWENTY MILES FROM THE CITY A PAIR OF ENORMOUS EGGS, IDENTICAL IN CONTOUR AND SEPARATED ONLY BY A COURTESY BAY, JUT OUT INTO THE MOST DOMESTICATED BODY OF SALT WATER IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, THE GREAT WET BARNYARD OF LONG ISLAND SOUNDnull0 - LONG ISLAND SOUND nullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull LONG ISLAND nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull THEY ARE NOT PERFECT OVALS nullLIKE THE EGG IN THE COLUMBUS STORYnull1 - THE EGG IN THE COLUMBUS STORY nullnullnull null nullnullnullnullnull null nullnullnullnull THEY ARE BOTH CRUSHED FLAT AT THE CONTACT END nullBUT THEIR PHYSICAL RESEMBLANCE MUST BE A SOURCE OF PERPETUAL WONDER TO THE GULLS THAT FLY OVERHEAD. TO THE WINGLESS A MORE INTERESTING PHENOMENON IS THEIR DISSIMILARITY IN EVERY PARTICULAR EXCEPT SHAPE AND SIZE.
null LIVED AT WEST EGG, THE nullWELL, THE LESS FASHIONABLE OF THE TWO, THOUGH THIS IS A MOST SUPERFICIAL TAG TO EXPRESS THE BIZARRE AND NOT A LITTLE SINISTER CONTRAST BETWEEN THEM. MY HOUSE WAS AT THE VERY TIP OF THE EGG, ONLY FIFTY YARDSnull2 - YARD nullnull nullnull null0,9144 nullFROM THE SOUND, AND SQUEEZED BETWEEN TWO HUGE PLACES THAT RENTED FOR TWELVE OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND A SEASON. THE ONE ON MY RIGHT WAS A COLOSSAL AFFAIR BY ANY STANDARD nullIT WAS A FACTUAL IMITATION OF SOME HOTEL DE VILLEnull3 - HOTEL DE VILLE (null) nullnullIN NORMANDYnull4 - NORMANDY nullnullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull WITH A TOWER ON ONE SIDE, SPANKING NEW UNDER A THIN BEARD OF RAW IVY, AND A MARBLE SWIMMING POOL, AND MORE THAN FORTY ACRESnull5 - ACRE nullnull nullnull null4,047 nullnullOF LAWN AND GARDEN. IT WAS GATSBYnull MANSION. OR, RATHER, AS I DIDNnull KNOW MR. GATSBY, IT WAS A MANSION INHABITED BY A GENTLEMAN OF THAT NAME. MY OWN HOUSE WAS AN EYESORE, BUT IT WAS A SMALL EYESORE, AND IT HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED, SO I HAD A VIEW OF THE WATER, A PARTIAL VIEW OF MY NEIGHBOURnull LAWN, AND THE CONSOLING PROXIMITY OF MILLIONAIRES nullALL FOR EIGHTY DOLLARS A MONTH.
nullCROSS THE COURTESY BAY THE WHITE PALACES OF FASHIONABLE EAST EGGnull6 - EAST EGG nullnullnullnullGLITTERED ALONG THE WATER, AND THE HISTORY OF THE SUMMER REALLY BEGINS ON THE EVENING I DROVE OVER THERE TO HAVE DINNER WITH THE TOM BUCHANANS. DAISY WAS MY SECOND COUSIN ONCE REMOVED, AND Inull KNOWN TOM IN COLLEGE. AND JUST AFTER THE WAR I SPENT TWO DAYS WITH THEM IN CHICAGO.
nullER HUSBAND, AMONG VARIOUS PHYSICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS, HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ENDS THAT EVER PLAYED FOOTBALL AT NEW HAVEN nullA NATIONAL FIGURE IN A WAY, ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO REACH SUCH AN ACUTE LIMITED EXCELLENCE AT TWENTY-ONE THAT EVERYTHING AFTERWARD SAVOURS OF ANTI-CLIMAX. HIS FAMILY WERE ENORMOUSLY WEALTHY nullEVEN IN COLLEGE HIS FREEDOM WITH MONEY WAS A MATTER FOR REPROACH nullBUT NOW HEnull LEFT CHICAGO AND COME EAST IN A FASHION THAT RATHER TOOK YOUR BREATH AWAY: FOR INSTANCE, HEnull BROUGHT DOWN A STRING OF POLO PONIES FROM LAKE FORESTnull7 - LAKE FOREST nullnullnullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnull1835 nullnull IT WAS HARD TO REALIZE THAT A MAN IN MY OWN GENERATION WAS WEALTHY ENOUGH TO DO THAT.
nullHY THEY CAME EAST I DONnull KNOW. THEY HAD SPENT A YEAR IN FRANCE FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON, AND THEN DRIFTED HERE AND THERE UNRESTFULLY WHEREVER PEOPLE PLAYED POLO AND WERE RICH TOGETHER. THIS WAS A PERMANENT MOVE, SAID DAISY OVER THE TELEPHONE, BUT I DIDNnull BELIEVE IT nullI HAD NO SIGHT INTO DAISYnull HEART, BUT I FELT THAT TOM WOULD DRIFT ON FOREVER SEEKING, A LITTLE WISTFULLY, FOR THE DRAMATIC TURBULENCE OF SOME IRRECOVERABLE FOOTBALL GAME.
nullND SO IT HAPPENED THAT ON A WARM WINDY EVENING I DROVE OVER TO EAST EGG TO SEE TWO OLD FRIENDS WHOM I SCARCELY KNEW AT ALL. THEIR HOUSE WAS EVEN MORE ELABORATE THAN I EXPECTED, A CHEERFUL RED-AND-WHITE GEORGIAN COLONIALnull8 - GEORGIAN COLONIAL (STYLE) nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull1714null830 null, nullnullnullnullnullnullI nullnullnullnullIV, nullnullnullnullnullnullMANSION, OVERLOOKING THE BAY. THE LAWN STARTED AT THE BEACH AND RAN TOWARD THE FRONT DOOR FOR A QUARTER OF A MILEnull9 - MILE nullnull nullnull null1609 null JUMPING OVER SUN-DIALS AND BRICK WALKS AND BURNING GARDENS nullFINALLY WHEN IT REACHED THE HOUSE DRIFTING UP THE SIDE IN BRIGHT VINES AS THOUGH FROM THE MOMENTUM OF ITS RUN. THE FRONT WAS BROKEN BY A LINE OF FRENCH WINDOWS, GLOWING NOW WITH REFLECTED GOLD AND WIDE OPEN TO THE WARM WINDY AFTERNOON, AND TOM BUCHANAN IN RIDING CLOTHES WAS STANDING WITH HIS LEGS APART ON THE FRONT PORCH.
nullE HAD CHANGED SINCE HIS NEW HAVEN YEARS. NOW HE WAS A STURDY STRAW-HAIRED MAN OF THIRTY WITH A RATHER HARD MOUTH AND A SUPERCILIOUS MANNER. TWO SHINING ARROGANT EYES HAD ESTABLISHED DOMINANCE OVER HIS FACE AND GAVE HIM THE APPEARANCE OF ALWAYS LEANING AGGRESSIVELY FORWARD. NOT EVEN THE EFFEMINATE SWANK OF HIS RIDING CLOTHES COULD HIDE THE ENORMOUS POWER OF THAT BODY nullHE THAT SEEMED TO FILL THOSE GLISTENING BOOTS UNTIL HE STRAINED THE TOP LACING, AND YOU COULD SEE A GREAT PACK OF MUSCLE SHIFTING WHEN HIS SHOULDER MOVED UNDER HIS THIN COAT. IT WAS A BODY CAPABLE OF ENORMOUS LEVERAGE nullA CRUEL BODY.
nullIS SPEAKING VOICE, A GRUFF HUSKY TENOR, ADDED TO THE IMPRESSION OF FRACTIOUSNESS HE CONVEYED. THERE WAS A TOUCH OF PATERNAL CONTEMPT IN IT, EVEN TOWARD PEOPLE HE LIKED nullAND THERE WERE MEN AT NEW HAVEN WHO HAD HATED HIS GUTS.
nullOW, DONnull THINK MY OPINION ON THESE MATTERS IS FINAL,nullHE SEEMED TO SAY, nullUST BECAUSE Inull STRONGER AND MORE OF A MAN THAN YOU ARE.nullWE WERE IN THE SAME SENIOR SOCIETY, AND WHILE WE WERE NEVER INTIMATE I ALWAYS HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT HE APPROVED OF ME AND WANTED ME TO LIKE HIM WITH SOME HARSH, DEFIANT WISTFULNESS OF HIS OWN.
nullE TALKED FOR A FEW MINUTES ON THE SUNNY PORCH.
nullnullE GOT A NICE PLACE HERE,nullHE SAID, HIS EYES FLASHING ABOUT RESTLESSLY.
nullURNING ME AROUND BY ONE ARM, HE MOVED A BROAD FLAT HAND ALONG THE FRONT VISTA, INCLUDING IN ITS SWEEP A SUNKEN ITALIAN GARDEN, A HALF ACRE OF DEEP, PUNGENT ROSES, AND A SNUB-NOSED MOTOR-BOAT THAT BUMPED THE TIDE OFFSHORE.
nullT BELONGED TO DEMAINE, THE OIL MAN.nullHE TURNED ME AROUND AGAIN, POLITELY AND ABRUPTLY.
nullEnullL GO INSIDE.nullE WALKED THROUGH A HIGH HALLWAY INTO A BRIGHT ROSY-COLOURED SPACE, FRAGILELY BOUND INTO THE HOUSE BY FRENCH WINDOWS AT EITHER END. THE WINDOWS WERE AJAR AND GLEAMING WHITE AGAINST THE FRESH GRASS OUTSIDE THAT SEEMED TO GROW A LITTLE WAY INTO THE HOUSE. A BREEZE BLEW THROUGH THE ROOM, BLEW CURTAINS IN AT ONE END AND OUT THE OTHER LIKE PALE FLAGS, TWISTING THEM UP TOWARD THE FROSTED WEDDING-CAKE OF THE CEILING, AND THEN RIPPLED OVER THE WINE-COLOURED RUG, MAKING A SHADOW ON IT AS WIND DOES ON THE SEA.
nullHE ONLY COMPLETELY STATIONARY OBJECT IN THE ROOM WAS AN ENORMOUS COUCH ON WHICH TWO YOUNG WOMEN WERE BUOYED UP AS THOUGH UPON AN ANCHORED BALLOON. THEY WERE BOTH IN WHITE, AND THEIR DRESSES WERE RIPPLING AND FLUTTERING AS IF THEY HAD JUST BEEN BLOWN BACK IN AFTER A SHORT FLIGHT AROUND THE HOUSE. I MUST HAVE STOOD FOR A FEW MOMENTS LISTENING TO THE WHIP AND SNAP OF THE CURTAINS AND THE GROAN OF A PICTURE ON THE WALL. THEN THERE WAS A BOOM AS TOM BUCHANAN SHUT THE REAR WINDOWS AND THE CAUGHT WIND DIED OUT ABOUT THE ROOM, AND THE CURTAINS AND THE RUGS AND THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN BALLOONED SLOWLY TO THE FLOOR.
nullHE YOUNGER OF THE TWO WAS A STRANGER TO ME. SHE WAS EXTENDED FULL LENGTH AT HER END OF THE DIVAN, COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS, AND WITH HER CHIN RAISED A LITTLE, AS IF SHE WERE BALANCING SOMETHING ON IT WHICH WAS QUITE LIKELY TO FALL. IF SHE SAW ME OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYES SHE GAVE NO HINT OF IT nullINDEED, I WAS ALMOST SURPRISED INTO MURMURING AN APOLOGY FOR HAVING DISTURBED HER BY COMING IN.
nullHE OTHER GIRL, DAISY, MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RISE nullSHE LEANED SLIGHTLY FORWARD WITH A CONSCIENTIOUS EXPRESSION nullTHEN SHE LAUGHED, AN ABSURD, CHARMING LITTLE LAUGH, AND I LAUGHED TOO AND CAME FORWARD INTO THE ROOM.
nullnull P-PARALYZED WITH HAPPINESS.nullHE LAUGHED AGAIN, AS IF SHE SAID SOMETHING VERY WITTY, AND HELD MY HAND FOR A MOMENT, LOOKING UP INTO MY FACE, PROMISING THAT THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WORLD SHE SO MUCH WANTED TO SEE. THAT WAS A WAY SHE HAD. SHE HINTED IN A MURMUR THAT THE SURNAME OF THE BALANCING GIRL WAS BAKER. (InullE HEARD IT SAID THAT DAISYnull MURMUR WAS ONLY TO MAKE PEOPLE LEAN TOWARD HER; AN IRRELEVANT CRITICISM THAT MADE IT NO LESS CHARMING.)
nullT ANY RATE, MISS BAKERnull LIPS FLUTTERED, SHE NODDED AT ME ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY, AND THEN QUICKLY TIPPED HER HEAD BACK AGAIN nullTHE OBJECT SHE WAS BALANCING HAD OBVIOUSLY TOTTERED A LITTLE AND GIVEN HER SOMETHING OF A FRIGHT. AGAIN A SORT OF APOLOGY AROSE TO MY LIPS. ALMOST ANY EXHIBITION OF COMPLETE SELF-SUFFICIENCY DRAWS A STUNNED TRIBUTE FROM ME.
null LOOKED BACK AT MY COUSIN, WHO BEGAN TO ASK ME QUESTIONS IN HER LOW, THRILLING VOICE. IT WAS THE KIND OF VOICE THAT THE EAR FOLLOWS UP AND DOWN, AS IF EACH SPEECH IS AN ARRANGEMENT OF NOTES THAT WILL NEVER BE PLAYED AGAIN. HER FACE WAS SAD AND LOVELY WITH BRIGHT THINGS IN IT, BRIGHT EYES AND A BRIGHT PASSIONATE MOUTH, BUT THERE WAS AN EXCITEMENT IN HER VOICE THAT MEN WHO HAD CARED FOR HER FOUND DIFFICULT TO FORGET: A SINGING COMPULSION, A WHISPERED nullISTEN,nullA PROMISE THAT SHE HAD DONE GAY, EXCITING THINGS JUST A WHILE SINCE AND THAT THERE WERE GAY, EXCITING THINGS HOVERING IN THE NEXT HOUR.
null TOLD HER HOW I HAD STOPPED OFF IN CHICAGO FOR A DAY ON MY WAY EAST, AND HOW A DOZEN PEOPLE HAD SENT THEIR LOVE THROUGH ME.
nullO THEY MISS ME?nullSHE CRIED ECSTATICALLY.
nullHE WHOLE TOWN IS DESOLATE. ALL THE CARS HAVE THE LEFT REAR WHEEL PAINTED BLACK AS A MOURNING WREATH, AND THEREnull A PERSISTENT WAIL ALL NIGHT ALONG THE NORTH SHORE.nullOW GORGEOUS! LETnull GO BACK, TOM. TOMORROW!nullTHEN SHE ADDED IRRELEVANTLY: nullOU OUGHT TO SEE THE BABY.nullnull LIKE TO.nullHEnull ASLEEP. SHEnull THREE YEARS OLD. HAVENnull YOU EVER SEEN HER?nullEVER.nullELL, YOU OUGHT TO SEE HER. SHEnull nullOM BUCHANAN, WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING RESTLESSLY ABOUT THE ROOM, STOPPED AND RESTED HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER.
nullHAT YOU DOING, NICK?nullnull A BOND MAN.nullHO WITH?null TOLD HIM.
nullEVER HEARD OF THEM,nullHE REMARKED DECISIVELY.
nullHIS ANNOYED ME.
nullOU WILL,nullI ANSWERED SHORTLY. nullOU WILL IF YOU STAY IN THE EAST.nullH, InullL STAY IN THE EAST, DONnull YOU WORRY,nullHE SAID GLANCING AT DAISY AND THEN BACK AT ME, AS IF HE WERE ALERT FOR SOMETHING MORE. nullnull BE A GOD DAMNED FOOL TO LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE.nullT THIS POINT MISS BAKER SAID: nullBSOLUTELY!nullWITH SUCH SUDDENNESS THAT I STARTED nullIT WAS THE FIRST WORD SHE HAD UTTERED SINCE I CAME INTO THE ROOM. EVIDENTLY IT SURPRISED HER AS MUCH AS IT DID ME, FOR SHE YAWNED AND WITH A SERIES OF RAPID, DEFT MOVEMENTS STOOD UP INTO THE ROOM.
nullnull STIFF,nullSHE COMPLAINED, nullnullE BEEN LYING ON THAT SOFA FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.nullONnull LOOK AT ME,nullDAISY RETORTED, nullnullE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU TO NEW YORK ALL AFTERNOON.nullO, THANKS,nullSAID MISS BAKER TO THE FOUR COCKTAILS JUST IN FROM THE PANTRY, nullnull ABSOLUTELY IN TRAINING.nullER HOST LOOKED AT HER INCREDULOUSLY.
nullOU ARE!nullHE TOOK DOWN HIS DRINK AS IF IT WERE A DROP IN THE BOTTOM OF A GLASS. nullOW YOU EVER GET ANYTHING DONE IS BEYOND ME.null LOOKED AT MISS BAKER, WONDERING WHAT IT WAS SHE nullOT DONEnull I ENJOYED LOOKING AT HER. SHE WAS A SLENDER, SMALL-BREASTED GIRL, WITH AN ERECT CARRIAGE, WHICH SHE ACCENTUATED BY THROWING HER BODY BACKWARD AT THE SHOULDERS LIKE A YOUNG CADET. HER GREY SUN-STRAINED EYES LOOKED BACK AT ME WITH POLITE RECIPROCAL CURIOSITY OUT OF A WAN, CHARMING, DISCONTENTED FACE. IT OCCURRED TO ME NOW THAT I HAD SEEN HER, OR A PICTURE OF HER, SOMEWHERE BEFORE.
nullOU LIVE IN WEST EGG,nullSHE REMARKED CONTEMPTUOUSLY. null KNOW SOMEBODY THERE.null DONnull KNOW A SINGLE nullOU MUST KNOW GATSBY.nullATSBY?nullDEMANDED DAISY. nullHAT GATSBY?nullEFORE I COULD REPLY THAT HE WAS MY NEIGHBOUR DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED; WEDGING HIS TENSE ARM IMPERATIVELY UNDER MINE, TOM BUCHANAN COMPELLED ME FROM THE ROOM AS THOUGH HE WERE MOVING A CHECKER TO ANOTHER SQUARE.
nullLENDERLY, LANGUIDLY, THEIR HANDS SET LIGHTLY ON THEIR HIPS, THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN PRECEDED US OUT ON TO A ROSY-COLOURED PORCH, OPEN TOWARD THE SUNSET, WHERE FOUR CANDLES FLICKERED ON THE TABLE IN THE DIMINISHED WIND.
nullHY CANDLES?nullOBJECTED DAISY, FROWNING. SHE SNAPPED THEM OUT WITH HER FINGERS. nullN TWO WEEKS ITnullL BE THE LONGEST DAY IN THE YEAR.nullSHE LOOKED AT US ALL RADIANTLY. nullO YOU ALWAYS WATCH FOR THE LONGEST DAY OF THE YEAR AND THEN MISS IT? I ALWAYS WATCH FOR THE LONGEST DAY IN THE YEAR AND THEN MISS IT.nullE OUGHT TO PLAN SOMETHING,nullYAWNED MISS BAKER, SITTING DOWN AT THE TABLE AS IF SHE WERE GETTING INTO BED.
nullLL RIGHT,nullSAID DAISY. nullHATnullL WE PLAN?nullSHE TURNED TO ME HELPLESSLY: nullHAT DO PEOPLE PLAN?nullEFORE I COULD ANSWER HER EYES FASTENED WITH AN AWED EXPRESSION ON HER LITTLE FINGER.
nullOOK!nullSHE COMPLAINED; null HURT IT.nullE ALL LOOKED nullTHE KNUCKLE WAS BLACK AND BLUE.
nullOU DID IT, TOM,nullSHE SAID ACCUSINGLY. null KNOW YOU DIDNnull MEAN TO, BUT YOU DID DO IT . THATnull WHAT I GET FOR MARRYING A BRUTE OF A MAN, A GREAT, BIG, HULKING PHYSICAL SPECIMEN OF A null HATE THAT WORD HULKING,nullOBJECTED TOM CROSSLY, nullVEN IN KIDDING.nullULKING,nullINSISTED DAISY.
nullOMETIMES SHE AND MISS BAKER TALKED AT ONCE, UNOBTRUSIVELY AND WITH A BANTERING INCONSEQUENCE THAT WAS NEVER QUITE CHATTER THAT WAS AS COOL AS THEIR WHITE DRESSES AND THEIR IMPERSONAL EYES IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL DESIRE. THEY WERE HERE, AND THEY ACCEPTED TOM AND ME, MAKING ONLY A POLITE PLEASANT EFFORT TO ENTERTAIN OR TO BE ENTERTAINED. THEY KNEW THAT PRESENTLY DINNER WOULD BE OVER AND A LITTLE LATER THE EVENING TOO WOULD BE OVER AND CASUALLY PUT AWAY. IT WAS SHARPLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WEST, WHERE AN EVENING WAS HURRIED FROM PHASE TO PHASE TOWARDS ITS CLOSE, IN A CONTINUALLY DISAPPOINTED ANTICIPATION OR ELSE IN SHEER NERVOUS DREAD OF THE MOMENT ITSELF.
nullOU MAKE ME FEEL UNCIVILIZED, DAISY,nullI CONFESSED ON MY SECOND GLASS OF CORKY BUT RATHER IMPRESSIVE CLARETnull0 - CLARET nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnull nullANnull YOU TALK ABOUT CROPS OR SOMETHING?null MEANT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR BY THIS REMARK, BUT IT WAS TAKEN UP IN AN UNEXPECTED WAY.
nullIVILIZATIONnull GOING TO PIECES,nullBROKE OUT TOM VIOLENTLY. nullnullE GOTTEN TO BE A TERRIBLE PESSIMIST ABOUT THINGS. HAVE YOU READ nullHE RISE OF THE COLOURED EMPIRESnullBY THIS MAN GODDARD?nullHY, NO,nullI ANSWERED, RATHER SURPRISED BY HIS TONE.
nullELL, ITnull A FINE BOOK, AND EVERYBODY OUGHT TO READ IT. THE IDEA IS IF WE DONnull LOOK OUT THE WHITE RACE WILL BE nullWILL BE UTTERLY SUBMERGED. ITnull ALL SCIENTIFIC STUFF; ITnull BEEN PROVED.nullOMnull GETTING VERY PROFOUND,nullSAID DAISY, WITH AN EXPRESSION OF UNTHOUGHTFUL SADNESS. nullE READS DEEP BOOKS WITH LONG WORDS IN THEM. WHAT WAS THAT WORD WE nullELL, THESE BOOKS ARE ALL SCIENTIFIC,nullUNTHOUGHTFUL SADNESS TOM, GLANCING AT HER IMPATIENTLY. nullHIS FELLOW HAS WORKED OUT THE WHOLE THING. ITnull UP TO US, WHO ARE THE DOMINANT RACE, TO WATCH OUT OR THESE OTHER RACES WILL HAVE CONTROL OF THINGS.nullEnullE GOT TO BEAT THEM DOWN,nullWHISPERED DAISY, WINKING FEROCIOUSLY TOWARD THE FERVENT SUN.
nullOU OUGHT TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA nullBEGAN MISS BAKER, BUT TOM INTERRUPTED HER BY SHIFTING HEAVILY IN HIS CHAIR.
nullHIS IDEA IS THAT WEnullE NORDICSnull1 - NORDICS, THE NORDIC RACE nullnullnull nullnull nullnull nullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnull I AM, AND YOU ARE, AND YOU ARE, AND nullAFTER AN INFINITESIMAL HESITATION HE INCLUDED DAISY WITH A SLIGHT NOD, AND SHE WINKED AT ME AGAIN. nullnullAND WEnullE PRODUCED ALL THE THINGS THAT GO TO MAKE CIVILIZATION nullOH, SCIENCE AND ART, AND ALL THAT. DO YOU SEE?nullHERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN HIS CONCENTRATION, AS IF HIS COMPLACENCY, MORE ACUTE THAN OF OLD, WAS NOT ENOUGH TO HIM ANYMORE. WHEN, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, THE TELEPHONE RANG INSIDE AND THE BUTLER LEFT THE PORCH DAISY SEIZED UPON THE MOMENTARY INTERRUPTION AND LEANED TOWARD ME.
nullnullL TELL YOU A FAMILY SECRET,nullSHE WHISPERED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. nullTnull ABOUT THE BUTLERnull NOSE. DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE BUTLERnull NOSE?nullHATnull WHY I CAME OVER TO-NIGHT.nullELL, HE WASNnull ALWAYS A BUTLER; HE USED TO BE THE SILVER POLISHER FOR SOME PEOPLE IN NEW YORK THAT HAD A SILVER SERVICE FOR TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE. HE HAD TO POLISH IT FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT, UNTIL FINALLY IT BEGAN TO AFFECT HIS NOSE nullHINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE,nullSUGGESTED MISS BAKER.
nullES. THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE, UNTIL FINALLY HE HAD TO GIVE UP HIS POSITION.nullOR A MOMENT THE LAST SUNSHINE FELL WITH ROMANTIC AFFECTION UPON HER GLOWING FACE; HER VOICE COMPELLED ME FORWARD BREATHLESSLY AS I LISTENED nullTHEN THE GLOW FADED, EACH LIGHT DESERTING HER WITH LINGERING REGRET, LIKE CHILDREN LEAVING A PLEASANT STREET AT DUSK.
nullHE BUTLER CAME BACK AND MURMURED SOMETHING CLOSE TO TOMnull EAR, WHEREUPON TOM FROWNED, PUSHED BACK HIS CHAIR, AND WITHOUT A WORD WENT INSIDE. AS IF HIS ABSENCE QUICKENED SOMETHING WITHIN HER, DAISY LEANED FORWARD AGAIN, HER VOICE GLOWING AND SINGING.
null LOVE TO SEE YOU AT MY TABLE, NICK. YOU REMIND ME OF A nullOF A ROSE, AN ABSOLUTE ROSE. DOESNnull HE?nullSHE TURNED TO MISS BAKER FOR CONFIRMATION: nullN ABSOLUTE ROSE?nullHIS WAS UNTRUE. I AM NOT EVEN FAINTLY LIKE A ROSE. SHE WAS ONLY EXTEMPORIZING, BUT A STIRRING WARMTH FLOWED FROM HER, AS IF HER HEART WAS TRYING TO COME OUT TO YOU CONCEALED IN ONE OF THOSE BREATHLESS, THRILLING WORDS. THEN SUDDENLY SHE THREW HER NAPKIN ON THE TABLE AND EXCUSED HERSELF AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE.
nullISS BAKER AND I EXCHANGED A SHORT GLANCE CONSCIOUSLY DEVOID OF MEANING. I WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN SHE SAT UP ALERTLY AND SAID nullH!nullIN A WARNING VOICE. A SUBDUED IMPASSIONED MURMUR WAS AUDIBLE IN THE ROOM BEYOND, AND MISS BAKER LEANED FORWARD UNASHAMED, TRYING TO HEAR. THE MURMUR TREMBLED ON THE VERGE OF COHERENCE, SANK DOWN, MOUNTED EXCITEDLY, AND THEN CEASED ALTOGETHER.
nullHIS MR. GATSBY YOU SPOKE OF IS MY NEIGHBOUR nullI BEGAN.
nullONnull TALK. I WANT TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENS.nullS SOMETHING HAPPENING?nullI INQUIRED INNOCENTLY.
nullOU MEAN TO SAY YOU DONnull KNOW?nullSAID MISS BAKER, HONESTLY SURPRISED. null THOUGHT EVERYBODY KNEW.null DONnull.nullHY nullSHE SAID HESITANTLY, nullOMnull GOT SOME WOMAN IN NEW YORK.nullOT SOME WOMAN?nullI REPEATED BLANKLY.
nullISS BAKER NODDED.
nullHE MIGHT HAVE THE DECENCY NOT TO TELEPHONE HIM AT DINNER TIME. DONnull YOU THINK?nullLMOST BEFORE I HAD GRASPED HER MEANING THERE WAS THE FLUTTER OF A DRESS AND THE CRUNCH OF LEATHER BOOTS, AND TOM AND DAISY WERE BACK AT THE TABLE.
nullT COULDNnull BE HELPED!nullCRIED DAISY WITH TENSE GAIETY.
nullHE SAT DOWN, GLANCED SEARCHINGLY AT MISS BAKER AND THEN AT ME, AND CONTINUED: null LOOKED OUTDOORS FOR A MINUTE, AND ITnull VERY ROMANTIC OUTDOORS. THEREnull A BIRD ON THE LAWN THAT I THINK MUST BE A NIGHTINGALE COME OVER ON THE CUNARD OR WHITE STAR LINEnull2 - THE CUNARD OR WHITE STAR LINE nullnullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnull(1787null865)null HEnull SINGING AWAY nullHER VOICE SANG: nullTnull ROMANTIC, ISNnull IT, TOM?nullERY ROMANTIC,nullHE SAID, AND THEN MISERABLY TO ME: nullF ITnull LIGHT ENOUGH AFTER DINNER, I WANT TO TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE STABLES.nullHE TELEPHONE RANG INSIDE, STARTLINGLY, AND AS DAISY SHOOK HER HEAD DECISIVELY AT TOM THE SUBJECT OF THE STABLES, IN FACT ALL SUBJECTS, VANISHED INTO AIR. AMONG THE BROKEN FRAGMENTS OF THE LAST FIVE MINUTES AT TABLE I REMEMBER THE CANDLES BEING LIT AGAIN, POINTLESSLY, AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF WANTING TO LOOK SQUARELY AT EVERY ONE, AND YET TO AVOID ALL EYES. I COULDNnull GUESS WHAT DAISY AND TOM WERE THINKING, BUT I DOUBT IF EVEN MISS BAKER, WHO SEEMED TO HAVE MASTERED A CERTAIN HARDY SCEPTICISM, WAS ABLE UTTERLY TO PUT THIS FIFTH GUESTnull SHRILL METALLIC URGENCY OUT OF MIND. TO A CERTAIN TEMPERAMENT THE SITUATION MIGHT HAVE SEEMED INTRIGUING nullMY OWN INSTINCT WAS TO TELEPHONE IMMEDIATELY FOR THE POLICE.
nullHE HORSES, NEEDLESS TO SAY, WERE NOT MENTIONED AGAIN. TOM AND MISS BAKER, WITH SEVERAL FEETnull3 - FEET nullnull nullnullFOOT nullnull nullnull null30,48 nullOF TWILIGHT BETWEEN THEM, STROLLED BACK INTO THE LIBRARY, AS IF TO A VIGIL BESIDE A PERFECTLY TANGIBLE BODY, WHILE, TRYING TO LOOK PLEASANTLY INTERESTED AND A LITTLE DEAF, I FOLLOWED DAISY AROUND A CHAIN OF CONNECTING VERANDAS TO THE PORCH IN FRONT. IN ITS DEEP GLOOM WE SAT DOWN SIDE BY SIDE ON A WICKER SETTEE.
nullAISY TOOK HER FACE IN HER HANDS AS IF FEELING ITS LOVELY SHAPE, AND HER EYES MOVED GRADUALLY OUT INTO THE VELVET DUSK. I SAW THAT TURBULENT EMOTIONS POSSESSED HER, SO I ASKED WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE SOME SEDATIVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER LITTLE GIRL.
nullE DONnull KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL, NICK,nullSHE SAID SUDDENLY. nullVEN IF WE ARE COUSINS. YOU DIDNnull COME TO MY WEDDING.null WASNnull BACK FROM THE WAR.nullHATnull TRUE.nullSHE HESITATED. nullELL, InullE HAD A VERY BAD TIME, NICK, AND Inull PRETTY CYNICAL ABOUT EVERYTHING.nullVIDENTLY SHE HAD REASON TO BE. I WAITED BUT SHE DIDNnull SAY ANY MORE, AND AFTER A MOMENT I RETURNED RATHER FEEBLY TO THE SUBJECT OF HER DAUGHTER.
null SUPPOSE SHE TALKS, AND nullEATS, AND EVERYTHING.nullH, YES.nullSHE LOOKED AT ME ABSENTLY. nullISTEN, NICK; LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I SAID WHEN SHE WAS BORN. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR?nullERY MUCH.nullTnullL SHOW YOU HOW InullE GOTTEN TO FEEL ABOUT nullTHINGS. WELL, SHE WAS LESS THAN AN HOUR OLD AND TOM WAS GOD KNOWS WHERE. I WOKE UP OUT OF THE ETHER WITH AN UTTERLY ABANDONED FEELING, AND ASKED THE NURSE RIGHT AWAY IF IT WAS A BOY OR A GIRL. SHE TOLD ME IT WAS A GIRL, AND SO I TURNED MY HEAD AWAY AND WEPT. nullLL RIGHT,nullI SAID, nullnull GLAD ITnull A GIRL. AND I HOPE SHEnullL BE A FOOL nullTHATnull THE BEST THING A GIRL CAN BE IN THIS WORLD, A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FOOL.nullOU SEE I THINK EVERYTHINGnull TERRIBLE ANYHOW,nullSHE WENT ON IN A CONVINCED WAY. nullVERYBODY THINKS SO nullTHE MOST ADVANCED PEOPLE. AND I KNOW. InullE BEEN EVERYWHERE AND SEEN EVERYTHING AND DONE EVERYTHING.nullHER EYES FLASHED AROUND HER IN A DEFIANT WAY, RATHER LIKE TOMnull, AND SHE LAUGHED WITH THRILLING SCORN. nullOPHISTICATED nullGOD, Inull SOPHISTICATED!nullHE INSTANT HER VOICE BROKE OFF, CEASING TO COMPEL MY ATTENTION, MY BELIEF, I FELT THE BASIC INSINCERITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID. IT MADE ME UNEASY, AS THOUGH THE WHOLE EVENING HAD BEEN A TRICK OF SOME SORT TO EXACT A CONTRIBUTORY EMOTION FROM ME. I WAITED, AND SURE ENOUGH, IN A MOMENT SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH AN ABSOLUTE SMIRK ON HER LOVELY FACE, AS IF SHE HAD ASSERTED HER MEMBERSHIP IN A RATHER DISTINGUISHED SECRET SOCIETY TO WHICH SHE AND TOM BELONGED.
nullnullnullNSIDE, THE CRIMSON ROOM BLOOMED WITH LIGHT. TOM AND MISS BAKER SAT AT EITHER END OF THE LONG COUCH AND SHE READ ALOUD TO HIM FROM THE SATURDAY EVENING POSTnull4 - THE SATURDAY EVENING POST nullnullnullnull nullnullnullnull1821 null1969 nullnullnullTHE WORDS, MURMUROUS AND UNINFLECTED, RUNNING TOGETHER IN A SOOTHING TUNE. THE LAMP-LIGHT, BRIGHT ON HIS BOOTS AND DULL ON THE AUTUMN-LEAF YELLOW OF HER HAIR, GLINTED ALONG THE PAPER AS SHE TURNED A PAGE WITH A FLUTTER OF SLENDER MUSCLES IN HER ARMS.
nullHEN WE CAME IN SHE HELD US SILENT FOR A MOMENT WITH A LIFTED HAND.
nullO BE CONTINUED,nullSHE SAID, TOSSING THE MAGAZINE ON THE TABLE, nullN OUR VERY NEXT ISSUE.nullER BODY ASSERTED ITSELF WITH A RESTLESS MOVEMENT OF HER KNEE, AND SHE STOOD UP.

nullS SHE FROM NEW YORK?nullI ASKED QUICKLY.
nullROM LOUISVILLEnull9 - LOUISVILLE nullnullnullnullnull nullnull1773 nullnull OUR WHITE GIRLHOOD WAS PASSED TOGETHER THERE. OUR BEAUTIFUL WHITE nullID YOU GIVE NICK A LITTLE HEART TO HEART TALK ON THE VERANDA?nullDEMANDED TOM SUDDENLY.
nullID I?nullSHE LOOKED AT ME. null CANnull SEEM TO REMEMBER, BUT I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THE NORDIC RACEnull0 - THE NORDIC RACE nullnullnull nullnullNORDICS (null null 17)null YES, Inull SURE WE DID. IT SORT OF CREPT UP ON US AND FIRST THING YOU KNOW nullONnull BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU HEAR, NICK,nullHE ADVISED ME.
null SAID LIGHTLY THAT I HAD HEARD NOTHING AT ALL, AND A FEW MINUTES LATER I GOT UP TO GO HOME. THEY CAME TO THE DOOR WITH ME AND STOOD SIDE BY SIDE IN A CHEERFUL SQUARE OF LIGHT. AS I STARTED MY MOTOR DAISY PEREMPTORILY CALLED: nullAIT!
null FORGOT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING, AND ITnull IMPORTANT. WE HEARD YOU WERE ENGAGED TO A GIRL OUT WEST.nullHATnull RIGHT,nullCORROBORATED TOM KINDLY. nullE HEARD THAT YOU WERE ENGAGED.nullTnull A LIBEL. Inull TOO POOR.nullUT WE HEARD IT,nullINSISTED DAISY, SURPRISING ME BY OPENING UP AGAIN IN A FLOWER-LIKE WAY. nullE HEARD IT FROM THREE PEOPLE, SO IT MUST BE TRUE.nullF COURSE I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE REFERRING TO, BUT I WASNnull EVEN VAGUELY ENGAGED. THE FACT THAT GOSSIP HAD PUBLISHED THE BANNS WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I HAD COME EAST. YOU CANnull STOP GOING WITH AN OLD FRIEND ON ACCOUNT OF RUMOURS, AND ON THE OTHER HAND I HAD NO INTENTION OF BEING RUMOURED INTO MARRIAGE.
nullHEIR INTEREST RATHER TOUCHED ME AND MADE THEM LESS REMOTELY RICH nullNEVERTHELESS, I WAS CONFUSED AND A LITTLE DISGUSTED AS I DROVE AWAY. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE THING FOR DAISY TO DO WAS TO RUSH OUT OF THE HOUSE, CHILD IN ARMS nullBUT APPARENTLY THERE WERE NO SUCH INTENTIONS IN HER HEAD. AS FOR TOM, THE FACT THAT HE nullAD SOME WOMAN IN NEW YORKnullWAS REALLY LESS SURPRISING THAN THAT HE HAD BEEN DEPRESSED BY A BOOK. SOMETHING WAS MAKING HIM NIBBLE AT THE EDGE OF STALE IDEAS AS IF HIS STURDY PHYSICAL EGOTISM NO LONGER NOURISHED HIS PEREMPTORY HEART.
nullLREADY IT WAS DEEP SUMMER ON ROADHOUSE ROOFS AND IN FRONT OF WAYSIDE GARAGES, WHERE NEW RED PETROL-PUMPS SAT OUT IN POOLS OF LIGHT AND WHEN I REACHED MY ESTATE AT WEST EGG I RAN THE CAR UNDER ITS SHED AND SAT FOR A WHILE ON AN ABANDONED GRASS ROLLER IN THE YARD. THE WIND HAD BLOWN OFF, LEAVING A LOUD, BRIGHT NIGHT, WITH WINGS BEATING IN THE TREES AND A PERSISTENT ORGAN SOUND AS THE FULL BELLOWS OF THE EARTH BLEW THE FROGS FULL OF LIFE. THE SILHOUETTE OF A MOVING CAT WAVERED ACROSS THE MOONLIGHT, AND, TURNING MY HEAD TO WATCH IT, I SAW THAT I WAS NOT ALONE nullFIFTY FEET AWAY A FIGURE HAD EMERGED FROM THE SHADOW OF MY NEIGHBOURnull MANSION AND WAS STANDING WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS REGARDING THE SILVER PEPPER OF THE STARS. SOMETHING IN HIS LEISURELY MOVEMENTS AND THE SECURE POSITION OF HIS FEET UPON THE LAWN SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS MR. GATSBY HIMSELF, COME OUT TO DETERMINE WHAT SHARE WAS HIS OF OUR LOCAL HEAVENS.
null DECIDED TO CALL TO HIM. MISS BAKER HAD MENTIONED HIM AT DINNER, AND THAT WOULD DO FOR AN INTRODUCTION. BUT I DIDNnull CALL TO HIM, FOR HE GAVE A SUDDEN INTIMATION THAT HE WAS CONTENT TO BE ALONE nullHE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS TOWARD THE DARK WATER IN A CURIOUS WAY, AND, FAR AS I WAS FROM HIM, I COULD HAVE SWORN HE WAS TREMBLING. INVOLUNTARILY I GLANCED SEAWARD nullAND DISTINGUISHED NOTHING EXCEPT A SINGLE GREEN LIGHT, MINUTE AND FAR AWAY, THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE END OF A DOCK. WHEN I LOOKED ONCE MORE FOR GATSBY HE HAD VANISHED, AND I WAS ALONE AGAIN IN THE UNQUIET DARKNESS.
nullHAPTER II
nullBOUT HALF WAY BETWEEN WEST EGG AND NEW YORK THE MOTOR ROAD HASTILY JOINS THE RAILROAD AND RUNS BESIDE IT FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE, SO AS TO SHRINK AWAY FROM A CERTAIN DESOLATE AREA OF LAND. THIS IS A VALLEY OF ASHES nullA FANTASTIC FARM WHERE ASHES GROW LIKE WHEAT INTO RIDGES AND HILLS AND GROTESQUE GARDENS; WHERE ASHES TAKE THE FORMS OF HOUSES AND CHIMNEYS AND RISING SMOKE AND, FINALLY, WITH A TRANSCENDENT EFFORT, OF ASH-GREY MEN, WHO MOVE DIMLY AND ALREADY CRUMBLING THROUGH THE POWDERY AIR. OCCASIONALLY A LINE OF GREY CARS CRAWLS ALONG AN INVISIBLE TRACK, GIVES OUT A GHASTLY CREAK, AND COMES TO REST, AND IMMEDIATELY THE ASH-GREY MEN SWARM UP WITH LEADEN SPADES AND STIR UP AN IMPENETRABLE CLOUD, WHICH SCREENS THEIR OBSCURE OPERATIONS FROM YOUR SIGHT.
nullUT ABOVE THE GREY LAND AND THE SPASMS OF BLEAK DUST WHICH DRIFT ENDLESSLY OVER IT, YOU PERCEIVE, AFTER A MOMENT, THE EYES OF DOCTOR T. J. ECKLEBURGnull1 - DOCTOR T. J. ECKLEBURG nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnull nullnull nullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull THE EYES OF DOCTOR T. J. ECKLEBURG ARE BLUE AND GIGANTIC nullTHEIR RETINAS ARE ONE YARD HIGH. THEY LOOK OUT OF NO FACE, BUT, INSTEAD, FROM A PAIR OF ENORMOUS YELLOW SPECTACLES WHICH PASS OVER A NON-EXISTENT NOSE. EVIDENTLY SOME WILD WAG OF AN OCULIST SET THEM THERE TO FATTEN HIS PRACTICE IN THE BOROUGH OF QUEENS, AND THEN SANK DOWN HIMSELF INTO ETERNAL BLINDNESS, OR FORGOT THEM AND MOVED AWAY. BUT HIS EYES, DIMMED A LITTLE BY MANY PAINTLESS DAYS, UNDER SUN AND RAIN, BROOD ON OVER THE SOLEMN DUMPING GROUND.
nullHE VALLEY OF ASHES IS BOUNDED ON ONE SIDE BY A SMALL FOUL RIVER, AND, WHEN THE DRAWBRIDGE IS UP TO LET BARGES THROUGH, THE PASSENGERS ON WAITING TRAINS CAN STARE AT THE DISMAL SCENE FOR AS LONG AS HALF AN HOUR. THERE IS ALWAYS A HALT THERE OF AT LEAST A MINUTE, AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT I FIRST MET TOM BUCHANANnull MISTRESS.
nullHE FACT THAT HE HAD ONE WAS INSISTED UPON WHEREVER HE WAS KNOWN. HIS ACQUAINTANCES RESENTED THE FACT THAT HE TURNED UP IN POPULAR CAFES WITH HER AND, LEAVING HER AT A TABLE, SAUNTERED ABOUT, CHATTING WITH WHOMSOEVER HE KNEW. THOUGH I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HER, I HAD NO DESIRE TO MEET HER nullBUT I DID. I WENT UP TO NEW YORK WITH TOM ON THE TRAIN ONE AFTERNOON, AND WHEN WE STOPPED BY THE ASH HEAPS HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND TAKING HOLD OF MY ELBOW, LITERALLY FORCED ME FROM THE CAR.
nullEnullE GETTING OFF,nullHE INSISTED. null WANT YOU TO MEET MY GIRL.null THINK HEnull TANKED UP A GOOD DEAL AT LUNCHEON, AND HIS DETERMINATION TO HAVE MY COMPANY BORDERED ON VIOLENCE. THE SUPERCILIOUS ASSUMPTION WAS THAT ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO.
null FOLLOWED HIM OVER A LOW WHITEWASHED RAILROAD FENCE, AND WE WALKED BACK A HUNDRED YARDS ALONG THE ROAD UNDER DOCTOR ECKLEBURGnull PERSISTENT STARE. THE ONLY BUILDING IN SIGHT WAS A SMALL BLOCK OF YELLOW BRICK SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE WASTE LAND, A SORT OF COMPACT MAIN STREET MINISTERING TO IT, AND CONTIGUOUS TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. ONE OF THE THREE SHOPS IT CONTAINED WAS FOR RENT AND ANOTHER WAS AN ALL-NIGHT RESTAURANT APPROACHED BY A TRAIL OF ASHES; THE THIRD WAS A GARAGE nullREPAIRS. GEORGE B. WILSON. CARS BOUGHT AND SOLD. nullAND I FOLLOWED TOM INSIDE.
nullHE INTERIOR WAS UNPROSPEROUS AND BARE; THE ONLY CAR VISIBLE WAS THE DUST-COVERED WRECK OF A FORD WHICH CROUCHED IN A DIM CORNER. IT HAD OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS SHADOW OF A GARAGE MUST BE A BLIND, AND THAT SUMPTUOUS AND ROMANTIC APARTMENTS WERE CONCEALED OVERHEAD, WHEN THE PROPRIETOR HIMSELF APPEARED IN THE DOOR OF AN OFFICE, WIPING HIS HANDS ON A PIECE OF WASTE. HE WAS A BLOND, SPIRITLESS MAN, ANAEMIC, AND FAINTLY HANDSOME. WHEN HE SAW US A DAMP GLEAM OF HOPE SPRANG INTO HIS LIGHT BLUE EYES.
nullELLO, WILSON, OLD MAN,nullSAID TOM, SLAPPING HIM JOVIALLY ON THE SHOULDER. nullOWnull BUSINESS?null CANnull COMPLAIN,nullANSWERED WILSON UNCONVINCINGLY. nullHEN ARE YOU GOING TO SELL ME THAT CAR?nullEXT WEEK; InullE GOT MY MAN WORKING ON IT NOW.nullORKS PRETTY SLOW, DONnull HE?nullO, HE DOESNnull,nullSAID TOM COLDLY. nullND IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT, MAYBE Inull BETTER SELL IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AFTER ALL.null DONnull MEAN THAT,nullEXPLAINED WILSON QUICKLY. null JUST MEANT nullIS VOICE FADED OFF AND TOM GLANCED IMPATIENTLY AROUND THE GARAGE. THEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS ON A STAIRS, AND IN A MOMENT THE THICKISH FIGURE OF A WOMAN BLOCKED OUT THE LIGHT FROM THE OFFICE DOOR. SHE WAS IN THE MIDDLE THIRTIES, AND FAINTLY STOUT, BUT SHE CARRIED HER FLESH SENSUOUSLY AS SOME WOMEN CAN. HER FACE, ABOVE A SPOTTED DRESS OF DARK BLUE CREPE-DE-CHINE, CONTAINED NO FACET OR GLEAM OF BEAUTY, BUT THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATELY PERCEPTIBLE VITALITY ABOUT HER AS IF THE NERVES OF HER BODY WERE CONTINUALLY SMOULDERING. SHE SMILED SLOWLY AND, WALKING THROUGH HER HUSBAND AS IF HE WERE A GHOST, SHOOK HANDS WITH TOM, LOOKING HIM FLUSH IN THE EYE. THEN SHE WET HER LIPS, AND WITHOUT TURNING AROUND SPOKE TO HER HUSBAND IN A SOFT, COARSE VOICE:
nullET SOME CHAIRS, WHY DONnull YOU, SO SOMEBODY CAN SIT DOWN.nullH, SURE,nullAGREED WILSON HURRIEDLY, AND WENT TOWARD THE LITTLE OFFICE, MINGLING IMMEDIATELY WITH THE CEMENT COLOUR OF THE WALLS. A WHITE ASHEN DUST VEILED HIS DARK SUIT AND HIS PALE HAIR AS IT VEILED EVERYTHING IN THE VICINITY nullEXCEPT HIS WIFE, WHO MOVED CLOSE TO TOM.
null WANT TO SEE YOU,nullSAID TOM INTENTLY nullET ON THE NEXT TRAIN.nullLL RIGHT.nullnullL MEET YOU BY THE NEWS-STAND ON THE LOWER LEVEL.nullHE NODDED AND MOVED AWAY FROM HIM JUST AS GEORGE WILSON EMERGED WITH TWO CHAIRS FROM HIS OFFICE DOOR.
nullE WAITED FOR HER DOWN THE ROAD AND OUT OF SIGHT. IT WAS A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE FOURTH OF JULYnull2 - THE FOURTH OF JULY nullnullnull nullnullnullnull AND A GREY, SCRAWNY ITALIAN CHILD WAS SETTING TORPEDOES IN A ROW ALONG THE RAILROAD TRACK.
nullERRIBLE PLACE, ISNnull IT,nullSAID TOM, EXCHANGING A FROWN WITH DOCTOR ECKLEBURG.
nullWFUL.nullT DOES HER GOOD TO GET AWAY.nullOESNnull HER HUSBAND OBJECT?nullILSON? HE THINKS SHE GOES TO SEE HER SISTER IN NEW YORK. HEnull SO DUMB HE DOESNnull KNOW HEnull ALIVE.nullO TOM BUCHANAN AND HIS GIRL AND I WENT UP TOGETHER TO NEW YORK nullOR NOT QUITE TOGETHER, FOR MRS. WILSON SAT DISCREETLY IN ANOTHER CAR. TOM DEFERRED THAT MUCH TO THE SENSIBILITIES OF THOSE EAST EGGERS WHO MIGHT BE ON THE TRAIN.
nullnullnullHE HAD CHANGED HER DRESS TO A BROWN FIGURED MUSLINnull3 - MUSLIN nullnull nullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull WHICH STRETCHED TIGHT OVER HER RATHER WIDE HIPS AS TOM HELPED HER TO THE PLATFORM IN NEW YORK. AT THE NEWS-STAND SHE BOUGHT A COPY OF TOWN TATTLEnull4 - TOWN TATTLE nullnullnullnullAND A MOVING-PICTURE MAGAZINE, AND IN TILE STATION DRUG-STORE SOME COLD CREAM AND A SMALL FLASK OF PERFUME. UPSTAIRS, IN THE SOLEMN ECHOING DRIVE SHE LET FOUR TAXICABS DRIVE AWAY BEFORE SHE SELECTED A NEW ONE, LAVENDER-COLOURED WITH GREY UPHOLSTERY, AND IN THIS WE SLID OUT FROM THE MASS OF THE STATION INTO THE GLOWING SUNSHINE. BUT IMMEDIATELY SHE TURNED SHARPLY FROM THE WINDOW AND, LEANING FORWARD, TAPPED ON THE FRONT GLASS.
null WANT TO GET ONE OF THOSE DOGS,nullSHE SAID EARNESTLY. null WANT TO GET ONE FOR THE APARTMENT. THEYnullE NICE TO HAVE nullA DOG.nullE BACKED UP TO A GREY OLD MAN WHO BORE AN ABSURD RESEMBLANCE TO JOHN D. ROCKEFELLERnull5 - JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER (1839null937) nullnullnullnullnullnull IN A BASKET SWUNG FROM HIS NECK COWERED A DOZEN VERY RECENT PUPPIES OF AN INDETERMINATE BREED.
nullHAT KIND ARE THEY?nullASKED MRS. WILSON EAGERLY, AS HE CAME TO THE TAXI-WINDOW.
nullLL KINDS. WHAT KIND DO YOU WANT, LADY?nullnull LIKE TO GET ONE OF THOSE POLICE DOGS; I DONnull SUPPOSE YOU GOT THAT KIND?nullHE MAN PEERED DOUBTFULLY INTO THE BASKET, PLUNGED IN HIS HAND AND DREW ONE UP, WRIGGLING, BY THE BACK OF THE NECK.
nullHATnull NO POLICE DOG,nullSAID TOM.
nullO, ITnull NOT EXACTLY A POLICE DOG,nullSAID THE MAN WITH DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS VOICE. nullTnull MORE OF AN AIREDALE.nullHE PASSED HIS HAND OVER THE BROWN WASHRAG OF A BACK. nullOOK AT THAT COAT. SOME COAT. THATnull A DOG THATnullL NEVER BOTHER YOU WITH CATCHING COLD.null THINK ITnull CUTE,nullSAID MRS. WILSON ENTHUSIASTICALLY. nullOW MUCH IS IT?nullHAT DOG?nullHE LOOKED AT IT ADMIRINGLY. nullHAT DOG WILL COST YOU TEN DOLLARS.nullHE AIREDALE nullUNDOUBTEDLY THERE WAS AN AIREDALE CONCERNED IN IT SOMEWHERE, THOUGH ITS FEET WERE STARTLINGLY WHITE nullCHANGED HANDS AND SETTLED DOWN INTO MRS. WILSONnull LAP, WHERE SHE FONDLED THE WEATHER-PROOF COAT WITH RAPTURE.
nullS IT A BOY OR A GIRL?nullSHE ASKED DELICATELY.
nullHAT DOG? THAT DOGnull A BOY.nullTnull A BITCH,nullSAID TOM DECISIVELY. nullEREnull YOUR MONEY. GO AND BUY TEN MORE DOGS WITH IT.nullE DROVE OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE, WARM AND SOFT, ALMOST PASTORAL, ON THE SUMMER SUNDAY AFTERNOON. I WOULDNnull HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO SEE A GREAT FLOCK OF WHITE SHEEP TURN THE CORNER.
nullOLD ON,nullI SAID, null HAVE TO LEAVE YOU HERE.nullO, YOU DONnull,nullINTERPOSED TOM QUICKLY. nullYRTLEnullL BE HURT IF YOU DONnull COME UP TO THE APARTMENT. WONnull YOU, MYRTLE?nullOME ON,nullSHE URGED. nullnullL TELEPHONE MY SISTER CATHERINE. SHEnull SAID TO BE VERY BEAUTIFUL BY PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO KNOW.nullELL, Inull LIKE TO, BUT nullE WENT ON, CUTTING BACK AGAIN OVER THE PARK TOWARD THE WEST HUNDREDSnull6 - THE WEST HUNDREDS nullnullnullnullnullnullnull AT 158TH STREET THE CAB STOPPED AT ONE SLICE IN A LONG WHITE CAKE OF APARTMENT-HOUSES. THROWING A REGAL HOMECOMING GLANCE AROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, MRS. WILSON GATHERED UP HER DOG AND HER OTHER PURCHASES, AND WENT HAUGHTILY IN.
nullnull GOING TO HAVE THE MCKEES COME UP,nullSHE ANNOUNCED AS WE ROSE IN THE ELEVATOR. nullND, OF COURSE, I GOT TO CALL UP MY SISTER, TOO.nullHE APARTMENT WAS ON THE TOP FLOOR nullA SMALL LIVING-ROOM, A SMALL DINING-ROOM, A SMALL BEDROOM, AND A BATH. THE LIVING-ROOM WAS CROWDED TO THE DOORS WITH A SET OF TAPESTRIED FURNITURE ENTIRELY TOO LARGE FOR IT, SO THAT TO MOVE ABOUT WAS TO STUMBLE CONTINUALLY OVER SCENES OF LADIES SWINGING IN THE GARDENS OF VERSAILLESnull7 - VERSAILLES nullnullnull nullnullnullnull nullnull1631null634 null nullnullnullnull16 nullnullnullnullnullnull THE ONLY PICTURE WAS AN OVER-ENLARGED PHOTOGRAPH, APPARENTLY A HEN SITTING ON A BLURRED ROCK. LOOKED AT FROM A DISTANCE, HOWEVER, THE HEN RESOLVED ITSELF INTO A BONNET, AND THE COUNTENANCE OF A STOUT OLD LADY BEAMED DOWN INTO THE ROOM. SEVERAL OLD COPIES OF TOWN TATTLE LAY ON THE TABLE TOGETHER WITH A COPY OF SIMON CALLED PETERnull8 - SIMON CALLED PETER nullnullnullnullnull1920-nullnull; nullnullnullnull null nullnullnullnullnullnull AND SOME OF THE SMALL SCANDAL MAGAZINES OF BROADWAY. MRS. WILSON WAS FIRST CONCERNED WITH THE DOG. A RELUCTANT ELEVATOR-BOY WENT FOR A BOX FULL OF STRAW AND SOME MILK, TO WHICH HE ADDED ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE A TIN OF LARGE, HARD DOG-BISCUITS nullONE OF WHICH DECOMPOSED APATHETICALLY IN THE SAUCER OF MILK ALL AFTERNOON. MEANWHILE TOM BROUGHT OUT A BOTTLE OF WHISKY FROM A LOCKED BUREAU DOOR.
null HAVE BEEN DRUNK JUST TWICE IN MY LIFE, AND THE SECOND TIME WAS THAT AFTERNOON; SO EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED HAS A DIM, HAZY CAST OVER IT, ALTHOUGH UNTIL AFTER EIGHT OnullLOCK THE APARTMENT WAS FULL OF CHEERFUL SUN. SITTING ON TOMnull LAP MRS. WILSON CALLED UP SEVERAL PEOPLE ON THE TELEPHONE; THEN THERE WERE NO CIGARETTES, AND I WENT OUT TO BUY SOME AT THE DRUGSTORE ON THE CORNER. WHEN I CAME BACK THEY HAD BOTH DISAPPEARED, SO I SAT DOWN DISCREETLY IN THE LIVING-ROOM AND READ A CHAPTER OF SIMON CALLED PETER nullEITHER IT WAS TERRIBLE STUFF OR THE WHISKY DISTORTED THINGS, BECAUSE IT DIDNnull MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.
nullUST AS TOM AND MYRTLE (AFTER THE FIRST DRINK MRS. WILSON AND I CALLED EACH OTHER BY OUR FIRST NAMES) REAPPEARED, COMPANY COMMENCED TO ARRIVE AT THE APARTMENT-DOOR.
nullHE SISTER, CATHERINE, WAS A SLENDER, WORLDLY GIRL OF ABOUT THIRTY, WITH A SOLID, STICKY BOB OF RED HAIR, AND A COMPLEXION POWDERED MILKY WHITE. HER EYEBROWS HAD BEEN PLUCKED AND THEN DRAWN ON AGAIN AT A MORE RAKISH ANGLE, BUT THE EFFORTS OF NATURE TOWARD THE RESTORATION OF THE OLD ALIGNMENT GAVE A BLURRED AIR TO HER FACE. WHEN SHE MOVED ABOUT THERE WAS AN INCESSANT CLICKING AS INNUMERABLE POTTERY BRACELETS JINGLED UP AND DOWN UPON HER ARMS. SHE CAME IN WITH SUCH A PROPRIETARY HASTE, AND LOOKED AROUND SO POSSESSIVELY AT THE FURNITURE THAT I WONDERED IF SHE LIVED HERE. BUT WHEN I ASKED HER SHE LAUGHED IMMODERATELY, REPEATED MY QUESTION ALOUD, AND TOLD ME SHE LIVED WITH A GIRL FRIEND AT A HOTEL.
nullR. MCKEE WAS A PALE, FEMININE MAN FROM THE FLAT BELOW. HE HAD JUST SHAVED, FOR THERE WAS A WHITE SPOT OF LATHER ON HIS CHEEKBONE, AND HE WAS MOST RESPECTFUL IN HIS GREETING TO EVERYONE IN THE ROOM. HE INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS IN THE nullRTISTIC GAMEnull AND I GATHERED LATER THAT HE WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER AND HAD MADE THE DIM ENLARGEMENT OF MRS. WILSONnull MOTHER WHICH HOVERED LIKE AN ECTOPLASM ON THE WALL. HIS WIFE WAS SHRILL, LANGUID, HANDSOME, AND HORRIBLE. SHE TOLD ME WITH PRIDE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD PHOTOGRAPHED HER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN TIMES SINCE THEY HAD BEEN MARRIED.
nullRS. WILSON HAD CHANGED HER COSTUME SOME TIME BEFORE, AND WAS NOW ATTIRED IN AN ELABORATE AFTERNOON DRESS OF CREAM-COLOURED CHIFFON, WHICH GAVE OUT A CONTINUAL RUSTLE AS SHE SWEPT ABOUT THE ROOM. WITH THE INFLUENCE OF THE DRESS HER PERSONALITY HAD ALSO UNDERGONE A CHANGE. THE INTENSE VITALITY THAT HAD BEEN SO REMARKABLE IN THE GARAGE WAS CONVERTED INTO IMPRESSIVE HAUTEUR. HER LAUGHTER, HER GESTURES, HER ASSERTIONS BECAME MORE VIOLENTLY AFFECTED MOMENT BY MOMENT, AND AS SHE EXPANDED THE ROOM GREW SMALLER AROUND HER, UNTIL SHE SEEMED TO BE REVOLVING ON A NOISY, CREAKING PIVOT THROUGH THE SMOKY AIR.
nullY DEAR,nullSHE TOLD HER SISTER IN A HIGH, MINCING SHOUT, nullOST OF THESE FELLAS WILL CHEAT YOU EVERY TIME. ALL THEY THINK OF IS MONEY. I HAD A WOMAN UP HERE LAST WEEK TO LOOK AT MY FEET, AND WHEN SHE GAVE ME THE BILL YOUnull OF THOUGHT SHE HAD MY APPENDICITIS OUT.nullHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE WOMAN?nullASKED MRS. MCKEE.
nullRS. EBERHARDT. SHE GOES AROUND LOOKING AT PEOPLEnull FEET IN THEIR OWN HOMES.null LIKE YOUR DRESS,nullREMARKED MRS. MCKEE, null THINK ITnull ADORABLE.nullRS. WILSON REJECTED THE COMPLIMENT BY RAISING HER EYEBROW IN DISDAIN.
nullTnull JUST A CRAZY OLD THING,nullSHE SAID. null JUST SLIP IT ON SOMETIMES WHEN I DONnull CARE WHAT I LOOK LIKE.nullUT IT LOOKS WONDERFUL ON YOU, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,nullPURSUED MRS. MCKEE. nullF CHESTER COULD ONLY GET YOU IN THAT POSE I THINK HE COULD MAKE SOMETHING OF IT.nullE ALL LOOKED IN SILENCE AT MRS. WILSON, WHO REMOVED A STRAND OF HAIR FROM OVER HER EYES AND LOOKED BACK AT US WITH A BRILLIANT SMILE. MR. MCKEE REGARDED HER INTENTLY WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE, AND THEN MOVED HIS HAND BACK AND FORTH SLOWLY IN FRONT OF HIS FACE.
null SHOULD CHANGE THE LIGHT,nullHE SAID AFTER A MOMENT. nullnull LIKE TO BRING OUT THE MODELING OF THE FEATURES. AND Inull TRY TO GET HOLD OF ALL THE BACK HAIR.null WOULDNnull THINK OF CHANGING THE LIGHT,nullCRIED MRS. MCKEE. null THINK ITnull nullER HUSBAND SAID: nullH!nullAND WE ALL LOOKED AT THE SUBJECT AGAIN, WHEREUPON TOM BUCHANAN YAWNED AUDIBLY AND GOT TO HIS FEET.
nullOU MCKEES HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK,nullHE SAID. nullET SOME MORE ICE AND MINERAL WATER, MYRTLE, BEFORE EVERYBODY GOES TO SLEEP.null TOLD THAT BOY ABOUT THE ICE.nullMYRTLE RAISED HER EYEBROWS IN DESPAIR AT THE SHIFTLESSNESS OF THE LOWER ORDERS. nullHESE PEOPLE! YOU HAVE TO KEEP AFTER THEM ALL THE TIME.nullHE LOOKED AT ME AND LAUGHED POINTLESSLY. THEN SHE FLOUNCED OVER TO THE DOG, KISSED IT WITH ECSTASY, AND SWEPT INTO THE KITCHEN, IMPLYING THAT A DOZEN CHEFS AWAITED HER ORDERS THERE.
nullnullE DONE SOME NICE THINGS OUT ON LONG ISLAND,nullASSERTED MR. MCKEE.
nullOM LOOKED AT HIM BLANKLY.

AND TOMnull THE FIRST SWEETIE SHE EVER HAD.nullHE BOTTLE OF WHISKY nullA SECOND ONE nullWAS NOW IN CONSTANT DEMAND BY ALL PRESENT, EXCEPTING CATHERINE, WHO nullELT JUST AS GOOD ON NOTHING AT ALLnull TOM RANG FOR THE JANITOR AND SENT HIM FOR SOME CELEBRATED SANDWICHES, WHICH WERE A COMPLETE SUPPER IN THEMSELVES. I WANTED TO GET OUT AND WALK EASTWARD TOWARD THE PARK THROUGH THE SOFT TWILIGHT, BUT EACH TIME I TRIED TO GO I BECAME ENTANGLED IN SOME WILD, STRIDENT ARGUMENT WHICH PULLED ME BACK, AS IF WITH ROPES, INTO MY CHAIR. YET HIGH OVER THE CITY OUR LINE OF YELLOW WINDOWS MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED THEIR SHARE OF HUMAN SECRECY TO THE CASUAL WATCHER IN THE DARKENING STREETS, AND I SAW HIM TOO, LOOKING UP AND WONDERING. I WAS WITHIN AND WITHOUT, SIMULTANEOUSLY ENCHANTED AND REPELLED BY THE INEXHAUSTIBLE VARIETY OF LIFE.
nullYRTLE PULLED HER CHAIR CLOSE TO MINE, AND SUDDENLY HER WARM BREATH POURED OVER ME THE STORY OF HER FIRST MEETING WITH TOM.
nullT WAS ON THE TWO LITTLE SEATS FACING EACH OTHER THAT ARE ALWAYS THE LAST ONES LEFT ON THE TRAIN. I WAS GOING UP TO NEW YORK TO SEE MY SISTER AND SPEND THE NIGHT. HE HAD ON A DRESS SUIT AND PATENT LEATHER SHOES, AND I COULDNnull KEEP MY EYES OFF HIM, BUT EVERY TIME HE LOOKED AT ME I HAD TO PRETEND TO BE LOOKING AT THE ADVERTISEMENT OVER HIS HEAD. WHEN WE CAME INTO THE STATION HE WAS NEXT TO ME, AND HIS WHITE SHIRT-FRONT PRESSED AGAINST MY ARM, AND SO I TOLD HIM Inull HAVE TO CALL A POLICEMAN, BUT HE KNEW I LIED. I WAS SO EXCITED THAT WHEN I GOT INTO A TAXI WITH HIM I DIDNnull HARDLY KNOW I WASNnull GETTING INTO A SUBWAY TRAIN. ALL I KEPT THINKING ABOUT, OVER AND OVER, WAS nullOU CANnull LIVE FOREVER; YOU CANnull LIVE FOREVER.nullnullHE TURNED TO MRS. MCKEE AND THE ROOM RANG FULL OF HER ARTIFICIAL LAUGHTER.
nullY DEAR,nullSHE CRIED, nullnull GOING TO GIVE YOU THIS DRESS AS SOON AS Inull THROUGH WITH IT. InullE GOT TO GET ANOTHER ONE TO-MORROW. Inull GOING TO MAKE A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS InullE GOT TO GET. A MASSAGE AND A WAVE, AND A COLLAR FOR THE DOG, AND ONE OF THOSE CUTE LITTLE ASH-TRAYS WHERE YOU TOUCH A SPRING, AND A WREATH WITH A BLACK SILK BOW FOR MOTHERnull GRAVE THATnullL LAST ALL SUMMER. I GOT TO WRITE DOWN A LIST SO I WONnull FORGET ALL THE THINGS I GOT TO DO.nullT WAS NINE OnullLOCK nullALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD I LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND FOUND IT WAS TEN. MR. MCKEE WAS ASLEEP ON A CHAIR WITH HIS FISTS CLENCHED IN HIS LAP, LIKE A PHOTOGRAPH OF A MAN OF ACTION. TAKING OUT MY HANDKERCHIEF I WIPED FROM HIS CHEEK THE SPOT OF DRIED LATHER THAT HAD WORRIED ME ALL THE AFTERNOON.
nullHE LITTLE DOG WAS SITTING ON THE TABLE LOOKING WITH BLIND EYES THROUGH THE SMOKE, AND FROM TIME TO TIME GROANING FAINTLY. PEOPLE DISAPPEARED, REAPPEARED, MADE PLANS TO GO SOMEWHERE, AND THEN LOST EACH OTHER, SEARCHED FOR EACH OTHER, FOUND EACH OTHER A FEW FEET AWAY. SOME TIME TOWARD MIDNIGHT TOM BUCHANAN AND MRS. WILSON STOOD FACE TO FACE DISCUSSING, IN IMPASSIONED VOICES, WHETHER MRS. WILSON HAD ANY RIGHT TO MENTION DAISYnull NAME.
nullAISY! DAISY! DAISY!nullSHOUTED MRS. WILSON. nullnullL SAY IT WHENEVER I WANT TO! DAISY! DAInullAKING A SHORT DEFT MOVEMENT, TOM BUCHANAN BROKE HER NOSE WITH HIS OPEN HAND.
nullHEN THERE WERE BLOODY TOWELS UPON THE BATHROOM FLOOR, AND WOMENnull VOICES SCOLDING, AND HIGH OVER THE CONFUSION A LONG BROKEN WAIL OF PAIN. MR. MCKEE AWOKE FROM HIS DOZE AND STARTED IN A DAZE TOWARD THE DOOR. WHEN HE HAD GONE HALFWAY HE TURNED AROUND AND STARED AT THE SCENE nullHIS WIFE AND CATHERINE SCOLDING AND CONSOLING AS THEY STUMBLED HERE AND THERE AMONG THE CROWDED FURNITURE WITH ARTICLES OF AID, AND THE DESPAIRING FIGURE ON THE COUCH, BLEEDING FLUENTLY, AND TRYING TO SPREAD A COPY OF TOWN TATTLE OVER THE TAPESTRY SCENES OF VERSAILLES. THEN MR. MCKEE TURNED AND CONTINUED ON OUT THE DOOR. TAKING MY HAT FROM THE CHANDELIER, I FOLLOWED.
nullOME TO LUNCH SOME DAY,nullHE SUGGESTED, AS WE GROANED DOWN IN THE ELEVATOR.
nullHERE?nullNYWHERE.nullEEP YOUR HANDS OFF THE LEVER,nullSNAPPED THE ELEVATOR BOY.
null BEG YOUR PARDON,nullSAID MR. MCKEE WITH DIGNITY, null DIDNnull KNOW I WAS TOUCHING IT.nullLL RIGHT,nullI AGREED, nullnullL BE GLAD TO.nullI WAS STANDING BESIDE HIS BED AND HE WAS SITTING UP BETWEEN THE SHEETS, CLAD IN HIS UNDERWEAR, WITH A GREAT PORTFOLIO IN HIS HANDS.

nullHAPTER III
nullHERE WAS MUSIC FROM MY NEIGHBOURnull HOUSE THROUGH THE SUMMER NIGHTS. IN HIS BLUE GARDENS MEN AND GIRLS CAME AND WENT LIKE MOTHS AMONG THE WHISPERINGS AND THE CHAMPAGNE AND THE STARS. AT HIGH TIDE IN THE AFTERNOON I WATCHED HIS GUESTS DIVING FROM THE TOWER OF HIS RAFT, OR TAKING THE SUN ON THE HOT SAND OF HIS BEACH WHILE HIS TWO MOTOR-BOATS SLIT THE WATERS OF THE SOUND, DRAWING AQUAPLANES OVER CATARACTS OF FOAM. ON WEEKENDS HIS ROLLS-ROYCE BECAME AN OMNIBUS, BEARING PARTIES TO AND FROM THE CITY BETWEEN NINE IN THE MORNING AND LONG PAST MIDNIGHT, WHILE HIS STATION WAGON SCAMPERED LIKE A BRISK YELLOW BUG TO MEET ALL TRAINS. AND ON MONDAYS EIGHT SERVANTS, INCLUDING AN EXTRA GARDENER, TOILED ALL DAY WITH MOPS AND SCRUBBING-BRUSHES AND HAMMERS AND GARDEN-SHEARS, REPAIRING THE RAVAGES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE.
nullVERY FRIDAY FIVE CRATES OF ORANGES AND LEMONS ARRIVED FROM A FRUITERER IN NEW YORK nullEVERY MONDAY THESE SAME ORANGES AND LEMONS LEFT HIS BACK DOOR IN A PYRAMID OF PULPLESS HALVES. THERE WAS A MACHINE IN THE KITCHEN WHICH COULD EXTRACT THE JUICE OF TWO HUNDRED ORANGES IN HALF AN HOUR IF A LITTLE BUTTON WAS PRESSED TWO HUNDRED TIMES BY A BUTLERnull THUMB.
nullT LEAST ONCE A FORTNIGHT A CORPS OF CATERERS CAME DOWN WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET OF CANVAS AND ENOUGH COLOURED LIGHTS TO MAKE A CHRISTMAS TREE OF GATSBYnull ENORMOUS GARDEN. ON BUFFET TABLES, GARNISHED WITH GLISTENING HORS-DnullEUVRE, SPICED BAKED HAMS CROWDED AGAINST SALADS OF HARLEQUIN DESIGNS AND PASTRY PIGS AND TURKEYS BEWITCHED TO A DARK GOLD. IN THE MAIN HALL A BAR WITH A REAL BRASS RAIL WAS SET UP, AND STOCKED WITH GINS AND LIQUORS AND WITH CORDIALS SO LONG FORGOTTEN THAT MOST OF HIS FEMALE GUESTS WERE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW ONE FROM ANOTHER.
nullY SEVEN OnullLOCK THE ORCHESTRA HAS ARRIVED, NO THIN FIVE-PIECE AFFAIR, BUT A WHOLE PIT FULL OF OBOES AND TROMBONES AND SAXOPHONES AND VIOLS AND CORNETS AND PICCOLOS, AND LOW AND HIGH DRUMS. THE LAST SWIMMERS HAVE COME IN FROM THE BEACH NOW AND ARE DRESSING UPSTAIRS; THE CARS FROM NEW YORK ARE PARKED FIVE DEEP IN THE DRIVE, AND ALREADY THE HALLS AND SALONS AND VERANDAS ARE GAUDY WITH PRIMARY COLOURS, AND HAIR BOBBED IN STRANGE NEW WAYS, AND SHAWLS BEYOND THE DREAMS OF CASTILEnull4 - CASTILE nullnull nullnullnullnullnull THE BAR IS IN FULL SWING, AND FLOATING ROUNDS OF COCKTAILS PERMEATE THE GARDEN OUTSIDE, UNTIL THE AIR IS ALIVE WITH CHATTER AND LAUGHTER, AND CASUAL INNUENDO AND INTRODUCTIONS FORGOTTEN ON THE SPOT, AND ENTHUSIASTIC MEETINGS BETWEEN WOMEN WHO NEVER KNEW EACH OTHERnull NAMES.
nullHE LIGHTS GROW BRIGHTER AS THE EARTH LURCHES AWAY FROM THE SUN, AND NOW THE ORCHESTRA IS PLAYING YELLOW COCKTAIL MUSIC, AND THE OPERA OF VOICES PITCHES A KEY HIGHER. LAUGHTER IS EASIER MINUTE BY MINUTE, SPILLED WITH PRODIGALITY, TIPPED OUT AT A CHEERFUL WORD. THE GROUPS CHANGE MORE SWIFTLY, SWELL WITH NEW ARRIVALS, DISSOLVE AND FORM IN THE SAME BREATH; ALREADY THERE ARE WANDERERS, CONFIDENT GIRLS WHO WEAVE HERE AND THERE AMONG THE STOUTER AND MORE STABLE, BECOME FOR A SHARP, JOYOUS MOMENT THE CENTRE OF A GROUP, AND THEN, EXCITED WITH TRIUMPH, GLIDE ON THROUGH THE SEA-CHANGE OF FACES AND VOICES AND COLOUR UNDER THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING LIGHT.
nullUDDENLY ONE OF THESE GYPSIES, IN TREMBLING OPAL, SEIZES A COCKTAIL OUT OF THE AIR, DUMPS IT DOWN FOR COURAGE AND, MOVING HER HANDS LIKE FRISCO, DANCES OUT ALONE ON THE CANVAS PLATFORM. A MOMENTARY HUSH; THE ORCHESTRA LEADER VARIES HIS RHYTHM OBLIGINGLY FOR HER, AND THERE IS A BURST OF CHATTER AS THE ERRONEOUS NEWS GOES AROUND THAT SHE IS GILDA GRAYnull UNDERSTUDY FROM THE FOLLIESnull5 - THE FOLLIES nullnullnullnull THE PARTY HAS BEGUN.
null BELIEVE THAT ON THE FIRST NIGHT I WENT TO GATSBYnull HOUSE I WAS ONE OF THE FEW GUESTS WHO HAD ACTUALLY BEEN INVITED. PEOPLE WERE NOT INVITED nullTHEY WENT THERE. THEY GOT INTO AUTOMOBILES WHICH BORE THEM OUT TO LONG ISLAND, AND SOMEHOW THEY ENDED UP AT GATSBYnull DOOR. ONCE THERE THEY WERE INTRODUCED BY SOMEBODY WHO KNEW GATSBY, AND AFTER THAT THEY CONDUCTED THEMSELVES ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF BEHAVIOUR ASSOCIATED WITH AN AMUSEMENT PARK. SOMETIMES THEY CAME AND WENT WITHOUT HAVING MET GATSBY AT ALL, CAME FOR THE PARTY WITH A SIMPLICITY OF HEART THAT WAS ITS OWN TICKET OF ADMISSION.
null HAD BEEN ACTUALLY INVITED. A CHAUFFEUR IN A UNIFORM OF ROBINnull-EGG BLUE CROSSED MY LAWN EARLY THAT SATURDAY MORNING WITH A SURPRISINGLY FORMAL NOTE FROM HIS EMPLOYER: THE HONOUR WOULD BE ENTIRELY GATSBYnull, IT SAID, IF I WOULD ATTEND HIS nullITTLE PARTYnullTHAT NIGHT. HE HAD SEEN ME SEVERAL TIMES, AND HAD INTENDED TO CALL ON ME LONG BEFORE, BUT A PECULIAR COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES HAD PREVENTED IT nullSIGNED JAY GATSBY, IN A MAJESTIC HAND.
nullRESSED UP IN WHITE FLANNELS I WENT OVER TO HIS LAWN A LITTLE AFTER SEVEN, AND WANDERED AROUND RATHER ILL AT EASE AMONG SWIRLS AND EDDIES OF PEOPLE I DIDNnull KNOW nullTHOUGH HERE AND THERE WAS A FACE I HAD NOTICED ON THE COMMUTING TRAIN. I WAS IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY THE NUMBER OF YOUNG ENGLISHMEN DOTTED ABOUT; ALL WELL DRESSED, ALL LOOKING A LITTLE HUNGRY, AND ALL TALKING IN LOW, EARNEST VOICES TO SOLID AND PROSPEROUS AMERICANS. I WAS SURE THAT THEY WERE SELLING SOMETHING: BONDS OR INSURANCE OR AUTOMOBILES. THEY WERE AT LEAST AGONIZINGLY AWARE OF THE EASY MONEY IN THE VICINITY AND CONVINCED THAT IT WAS THEIRS FOR A FEW WORDS IN THE RIGHT KEY.
nullS SOON AS I ARRIVED I MADE AN ATTEMPT TO FIND MY HOST, BUT THE TWO OR THREE PEOPLE OF WHOM I ASKED HIS WHEREABOUTS STARED AT ME IN SUCH AN AMAZED WAY, AND DENIED SO VEHEMENTLY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HIS MOVEMENTS, THAT I SLUNK OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COCKTAIL TABLE nullTHE ONLY PLACE IN THE GARDEN WHERE A SINGLE MAN COULD LINGER WITHOUT LOOKING PURPOSELESS AND ALONE.
null WAS ON MY WAY TO GET ROARING DRUNK FROM SHEER EMBARRASSMENT WHEN JORDAN BAKER CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND STOOD AT THE HEAD OF THE MARBLE STEPS, LEANING A LITTLE BACKWARD AND LOOKING WITH CONTEMPTUOUS INTEREST DOWN INTO THE GARDEN.
nullELCOME OR NOT, I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO ATTACH MYSELF TO SOMEONE BEFORE I SHOULD BEGIN TO ADDRESS CORDIAL REMARKS TO THE PASSERS-BY.
nullELLO!nullI ROARED, ADVANCING TOWARD HER. MY VOICE SEEMED UNNATURALLY LOUD ACROSS THE GARDEN.
null THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE HERE,nullSHE RESPONDED ABSENTLY AS I CAME UP. null REMEMBERED YOU LIVED NEXT DOOR TO nullHE HELD MY HAND IMPERSONALLY, AS A PROMISE THAT SHEnull TAKE CARE OF ME IN A MINUTE, AND GAVE EAR TO TWO GIRLS IN TWIN YELLOW DRESSES, WHO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS.
nullELLO!nullTHEY CRIED TOGETHER. nullORRY YOU DIDNnull WIN.nullHAT WAS FOR THE GOLF TOURNAMENT. SHE HAD LOST IN THE FINALS THE WEEK BEFORE.
nullOU DONnull KNOW WHO WE ARE,nullSAID ONE OF THE GIRLS IN YELLOW, nullUT WE MET YOU HERE ABOUT A MONTH AGO.nullOUnullE DYED YOUR HAIR SINCE THEN,nullREMARKED JORDAN, AND I STARTED, BUT THE GIRLS HAD MOVED CASUALLY ON AND HER REMARK WAS ADDRESSED TO THE PREMATURE MOON, PRODUCED LIKE THE SUPPER, NO DOUBT, OUT OF A CATERERnull BASKET. WITH JORDANnull SLENDER GOLDEN ARM RESTING IN MINE, WE DESCENDED THE STEPS AND SAUNTERED ABOUT THE GARDEN. A TRAY OF COCKTAILS FLOATED AT US THROUGH THE TWILIGHT, AND WE SAT DOWN AT A TABLE WITH THE TWO GIRLS IN YELLOW AND THREE MEN, EACH ONE INTRODUCED TO US AS MR. MUMBLE.
nullO YOU COME TO THESE PARTIES OFTEN?nullINQUIRED JORDAN OF THE GIRL BESIDE HER.
nullHE LAST ONE WAS THE ONE I MET YOU AT,nullANSWERED THE GIRL, IN AN ALERT CONFIDENT VOICE. SHE TURNED TO HER COMPANION: nullASNnull IT FOR YOU, LUCILLE?nullT WAS FOR LUCILLE, TOO.
null LIKE TO COME,nullLUCILLE SAID. null NEVER CARE WHAT I DO, SO I ALWAYS HAVE A GOOD TIME. WHEN I WAS HERE LAST I TORE MY GOWN ON A CHAIR, AND HE ASKED ME MY NAME AND ADDRESS nullINSIDE OF A WEEK I GOT A PACKAGE FROM CROIRIERnull WITH A NEW EVENING GOWN IN IT. nullID YOU KEEP IT?nullASKED JORDAN.
nullURE I DID. I WAS GOING TO WEAR IT TO-NIGHT, BUT IT WAS TOO BIG IN THE BUST AND HAD TO BE ALTERED. IT WAS GAS BLUE WITH LAVENDER BEADS. TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FIVE DOLLARS.nullHEREnull SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT A FELLOW THATnullL DO A THING LIKE THAT,nullSAID THE OTHER GIRL EAGERLY. nullE DOESNnull WANT ANY TROUBLE WITH ANYBODY.nullHO DOESNnull?nullI INQUIRED.
nullATSBY. SOMEBODY TOLD ME nullnullHE TWO GIRLS AND JORDAN LEANED TOGETHER CONFIDENTIALLY.
nullOMEBODY TOLD ME THEY THOUGHT HE KILLED A MAN ONCE.null THRILL PASSED OVER ALL OF US. THE THREE MR. MUMBLES BENT FORWARD AND LISTENED EAGERLY.
null DONnull THINK ITnull SO MUCH THAT,nullARGUED LUCILLE SCEPTICALLY; nullTnull MORE THAT HE WAS A GERMAN SPY DURING THE WAR.nullNE OF THE MEN NODDED IN CONFIRMATION.
null HEARD THAT FROM A MAN WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT HIM, GREW UP WITH HIM IN GERMANY,nullHE ASSURED US POSITIVELY.
nullH, NO,nullSAID THE FIRST GIRL, nullT COULDNnull BE THAT, BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE AMERICAN ARMY DURING THE WAR.nullAS OUR CREDULITY SWITCHED BACK TO HER SHE LEANED FORWARD WITH ENTHUSIASM. nullOU LOOK AT HIM SOMETIMES WHEN HE THINKS NOBODYnull LOOKING AT HIM. InullL BET HE KILLED A MAN.nullHE NARROWED HER EYES AND SHIVERED. LUCILLE SHIVERED. WE ALL TURNED AND LOOKED AROUND FOR GATSBY. IT WAS TESTIMONY TO THE ROMANTIC SPECULATION HE INSPIRED THAT THERE WERE WHISPERS ABOUT HIM FROM THOSE WHO HAD FOUND LITTLE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO WHISPER ABOUT IN THIS WORLD.
nullHE FIRST SUPPER nullTHERE WOULD BE ANOTHER ONE AFTER MIDNIGHT nullWAS NOW BEING SERVED, AND JORDAN INVITED ME TO JOIN HER OWN PARTY, WHO WERE SPREAD AROUND A TABLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GARDEN. THERE WERE THREE MARRIED COUPLES AND JORDANnull ESCORT, A PERSISTENT UNDERGRADUATE GIVEN TO VIOLENT INNUENDO, AND OBVIOUSLY UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SOONER OR LATER JORDAN WAS GOING TO YIELD HIM UP HER PERSON TO A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE. INSTEAD OF RAMBLING, THIS PARTY HAD PRESERVED A DIGNIFIED HOMOGENEITY, AND ASSUMED TO ITSELF THE FUNCTION OF REPRESENTING THE STAID NOBILITY OF THE COUNTRYSIDE nullEAST EGG CONDESCENDING TO WEST EGG AND CAREFULLY ON GUARD AGAINST ITS SPECTROSCOPIC GAIETY.
nullETnull GET OUT,nullWHISPERED JORDAN, AFTER A SOMEHOW WASTEFUL AND INAPPROPRIATE HALF-HOUR; nullHIS IS MUCH TOO POLITE FOR ME.nullE GOT UP, AND SHE EXPLAINED THAT WE WERE GOING TO FIND THE HOST: I HAD NEVER MET HIM, SHE SAID, AND IT WAS MAKING ME UNEASY. THE UNDERGRADUATE NODDED IN A CYNICAL, MELANCHOLY WAY.
nullHE BAR, WHERE WE GLANCED FIRST, WAS CROWDED, BUT GATSBY WAS NOT THERE. SHE COULDNnull FIND HIM FROM THE TOP OF THE STEPS, AND HE WASNnull ON THE VERANDA. ON A CHANCE WE TRIED AN IMPORTANT-LOOKING DOOR, AND WALKED INTO A HIGH GOTHICnull6 - GOTHIC nullnull nullnullnull nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullXII nullnullXVI nullnullLIBRARY, PANELED WITH CARVED ENGLISH OAK, AND PROBABLY TRANSPORTED COMPLETE FROM SOME RUIN OVERSEAS.
null STOUT, MIDDLE-AGED MAN, WITH ENORMOUS OWL-EYED SPECTACLES, WAS SITTING SOMEWHAT DRUNK ON THE EDGE OF A GREAT TABLE, STARING WITH UNSTEADY CONCENTRATION AT THE SHELVES OF BOOKS. AS WE ENTERED HE WHEELED EXCITEDLY AROUND AND EXAMINED JORDAN FROM HEAD TO FOOT.
nullHAT DO YOU THINK?nullHE DEMANDED IMPETUOUSLY.
nullBOUT WHAT?nullE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE BOOK-SHELVES.
nullBOUT THAT. AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU NEEDNnull BOTHER TO ASCERTAIN. I ASCERTAINED. THEYnullE REAL.nullHE BOOKS?nullE NODDED.

LEMME SHOW YOU.nullAKING OUR SCEPTICISM FOR GRANTED, HE RUSHED TO THE BOOKCASES AND RETURNED WITH VOLUME ONE OF THE STODDARD LECTURESnull7 - STODDARD LECTURES nullnullnullnullnull nullnullnullnullnull null(1850null931)null
nullEE!nullHE CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY. nullTnull A BONA-FIDE PIECE OF PRINTED MATTER. IT FOOLED ME. THIS FELLAnull A REGULAR BELASCOnull8 - BELASCO nullnullnull(1853null931), nullnull nullnull nullnullnullnull ITnull A TRIUMPH. WHAT THOROUGHNESS! WHAT REALISM! KNEW WHEN TO STOP, TOO nullDIDNnull CUT THE PAGES. BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? nullE SNATCHED THE BOOK FROM ME AND REPLACED IT HASTILY ON ITS SHELF, MUTTERING THAT IF ONE BRICK WAS REMOVED THE WHOLE LIBRARY WAS LIABLE TO COLLAPSE.
nullHO BROUGHT YOU?nullHE DEMANDED. nullR DID YOU JUST COME? I WAS BROUGHT. MOST PEOPLE WERE BROUGHT.nullORDAN LOOKED AT HIM ALERTLY, CHEERFULLY, WITHOUT ANSWERING.
null WAS BROUGHT BY A WOMAN NAMED ROOSEVELT,nullHE CONTINUED. nullRS. CLAUD ROOSEVELT. DO YOU KNOW HER? I MET HER SOMEWHERE LAST NIGHT. InullE BEEN DRUNK FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW, AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT SOBER ME UP TO SIT IN A LIBRARY.nullAS IT?null LITTLE BIT, I THINK. I CANnull TELL YET. InullE ONLY BEEN HERE AN HOUR. DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THE BOOKS? THEYnullE REAL. THEYnullE nullnullOU TOLD US. nullE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM GRAVELY AND WENT BACK OUTDOORS.
nullHERE WAS DANCING NOW ON THE CANVAS IN THE GARDEN, OLD MEN PUSHING YOUNG GIRLS BACKWARD IN ETERNAL GRACELESS CIRCLES, SUPERIOR COUPLES HOLDING EACH OTHER TORTUOUSLY, FASHIONABLY, AND KEEPING IN THE CORNERS nullAND A GREAT NUMBER OF SINGLE GIRLS DANCING INDIVIDUALISTICALLY OR RELIEVING THE ORCHESTRA FOR A MOMENT OF THE BURDEN OF THE BANJO OR THE TRAPS. BY MIDNIGHT THE HILARITY HAD INCREASED. A CELEBRATED TENOR HAD SUNG IN ITALIAN, AND A NOTORIOUS CONTRALTO HAD SUNG IN JAZZ, AND BETWEEN THE NUMBERS PEOPLE WERE DOING nullTUNTSnullALL OVER THE GARDEN, WHILE HAPPY, VACUOUS BURSTS OF LAUGHTER ROSE TOWARD THE SUMMER SKY. A PAIR OF STAGE TWINS, WHO TURNED OUT TO BE THE GIRLS IN YELLOW, DID A BABY ACT IN COSTUME, AND CHAMPAGNE WAS SERVED IN GLASSES BIGGER THAN FINGER-BOWLS. THE MOON HAD RISEN HIGHER, AND FLOATING IN THE SOUND WAS A TRIANGLE OF SILVER SCALES, TREMBLING A LITTLE TO THE STIFF, TINNY DRIP OF THE BANJOESnull9 - BANJO nullnullnullnullnullnullON THE LAWN.
null WAS STILL WITH JORDAN BAKER. WE WERE SITTING AT A TABLE WITH A MAN OF ABOUT MY AGE AND A ROWDY LITTLE GIRL, WHO GAVE WAY UPON THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION TO UNCONTROLLABLE LAUGHTER. I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF NOW. I HAD TAKEN TWO FINGER-BOWLS OF CHAMPAGNE, AND THE SCENE HAD CHANGED BEFORE MY EYES INTO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT, ELEMENTAL, AND PROFOUND.
nullT A LULL IN THE ENTERTAINMENT THE MAN LOOKED AT ME AND SMILED.
nullOUR FACE IS FAMILIAR,nullHE SAID, POLITELY. nullERENnull YOU IN THE FIRST DIVISION DURING THE WAR?nullHY, YES. I WAS IN THE TWENTY-EIGHTH INFANTRY.null WAS IN THE SIXTEENTH UNTIL JUNE NINETEEN-EIGHTEEN. I KNEW Inull SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE BEFORE.nullE TALKED FOR A MOMENT ABOUT SOME WET, GREY LITTLE VILLAGES IN FRANCE. EVIDENTLY HE LIVED IN THIS VICINITY, FOR HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD JUST BOUGHT A HYDROPLANE, AND WAS GOING TO TRY IT OUT IN THE MORNING.
nullANT TO GO WITH ME, OLD SPORT? JUST NEAR THE SHORE ALONG THE SOUND.null
